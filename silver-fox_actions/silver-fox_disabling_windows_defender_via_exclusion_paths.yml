source: CTI Report
supported_platforms:
  - Windows
tactics:
  - Defense Evasion
technique:
  - 'Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools'
description: |
  This technique, used by actors like Silver Fox, involves using the `Set-MpPreference` PowerShell 
  cmdlet to add an exclusion path to Windows Defender. By excluding a specific directory (or an entire drive),
  an attacker can place and execute malicious tools and payloads within that location without being detected by
  Microsoft Defender's real-time protection or scheduled scans. This provides a safe haven for the attacker's 
  operations on the compromised host.
execution:
  executor: powershell
  command: Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\", "D:\", "E:\", "F:\", "G:\", "H:\", "I:\", "J:\", "K:\", "L:\", "M:\", "N:\", "O:\", "P:\", "Q:\", "R:\", "S:\", "T:\", "U:\", "V:\", "W:\", "X:\", "Y:\", "Z:\"
arguments: {}
preconditions:
  - (powershell ?eID - executor ?target - host)
  - (administrator_user ?user - user)
effects:
  - (windows_defender_excluded_paths ?target - host)
