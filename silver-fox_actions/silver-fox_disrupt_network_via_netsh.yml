  - Impair Defenses
description: |
  This technique, used by actors like Silver Fox, involves using the built-in Windows `netsh` utility to assign 
  an invalid static IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0) to a network interface. This action immediately severs the host's 
  network connectivity. The primary goal is to prevent endpoint security products from communicating with their 
  cloud-based services, thus blocking them from receiving updated detection signatures or uploading suspicious 
  samples for analysis. This creates a window of opportunity for the attacker to execute further actions without cloud-based monitoring.
execution:
  executor: powershell
  command: netsh interface ip set address name="#{interface_name}" static "#{invalid_ip}" "#{invalid_mask}"
arguments:
  interface_name:
    CurrentSetting: Ethernet0
    Required: true
    Description: The name of the target network connection to modify. Common names include 'Ethernet' or 'Local Area Connection'.
  invalid_ip:
    CurrentSetting: 0.0.0.0
    Required: true
    Description: The invalid static IP address used to disrupt network connectivity.
  invalid_mask:
    CurrentSetting: 0.0.0.0
    Required: true
    Description: A corresponding invalid subnet mask.
preconditions:
  - (powershell_session ?eID - executor ?target - host)
