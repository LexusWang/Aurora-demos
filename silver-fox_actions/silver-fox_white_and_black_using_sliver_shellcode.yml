description: |
  The threat actor "Silver Fox" often abuses legitimate, digitally signed programs to execute malicious code 
  via techniques like DLL hijacking. This simulation emulates their common attack vector, where a legitimate 
  application (the "white" component, e.g., cloudmusic_reporter.exe) is tricked into loading a malicious DLL 
  (the "black" component) containing Sliver shellcode. This method is effective at bypassing security products 
  by masking malicious activity within a trusted process.
execution:
  executor: powershell
  command: |
    Start-Process -FilePath "Path\To\LegitimateApp\#{executable_name}"
arguments:
  executable_name:
    CurrentSetting: cloudmusic_reporter.exe
    Required: true
    Description: The name of the legitimate, signed executable that will be exploited to load the malicious DLL.
preconditions:
  - (powershell_session ?eID - executor ?target - host)
  - (legitimate_executable ?target - host ?bypass - executable)
effects:
  - (sliver_session ?eID - executor ?target - host)
