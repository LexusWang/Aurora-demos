-   Introduces AURORA, a cyberattack emulation system that leverages classical planning (PDDL) and Large Language Models (LLMs).
-   Constructs an extensive attack space containing over 5,000 attack actions and 1,000 attack chains.
-   Generates high-quality attack plans with comprehensive TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) coverage.
-   Automatically sets up the attack emulation environments and semi-automatically executes the attacks.

Aurora‚Äôs architecture comprises five components:
- `Attack Tool Analysis`: Converts third-party tool documentation into structured attack actions using rule-based and LLM-assisted predicate extraction.
- `Attack Report Analysis`: Extracts Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from CTI reports via LLMs to guide attack planning.
- `Attack Planning`: Uses PDDL and reward functions (aligned with CTI-derived TTPs) to generate attack chains.
- `Attack Environment Builder`: Deploys pre-configured virtual machines to replicate vulnerable environments.
- `Attack Execution`: Semi-automatically runs attack scripts and collects traces for dataset construction.
