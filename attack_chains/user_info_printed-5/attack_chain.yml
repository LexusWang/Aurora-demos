    description: This module exploits an authenticated file upload vulnerability in
      Subrion CMS versions 4.2.1 and lower. The vulnerability is caused by the .htaccess
      file not preventing the execution of .pht, .phar, and .xhtml files. Files with
      these extensions are not included in the .htaccess blacklist, hence these files
      can be uploaded and executed to achieve remote code execution. In this module,
      a .phar file with a randomized name is uploaded and executed to receive a Meterpreter
      session on the target, then deletes itself afterwards.
