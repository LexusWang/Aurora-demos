    name: WordPress File Manager Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution

    source: Metasploit Exploit
    supported_platforms:

    tactics:
      - Execution
      - Initial Access
    technique:
      - Exploitation for Client Execution
      - Exploitation of Remote Services
    description: The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin from 6.0 to 6.8 for WordPress
      allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it
      renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension.
      This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and
      put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/
      directory.
