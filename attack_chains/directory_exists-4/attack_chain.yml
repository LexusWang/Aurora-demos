    description: |
      In Metasploit, the exploit/multi/handler module is essentially a universal payload handler.
      Unlike most exploit modules in Metasploit that target specific vulnerabilities, multi/handler does not exploit a particular service or software.
      Instead, its main purpose is to listen for incoming connections from payloads that you have already delivered to a target by some other means.

      payload in the current process. It allows users to specify various options such
      as the encoder type, number of encoding iterations, listening host and port,
      payload type, and command timeout. By default, it uses the "meterpreter_reverse_https"
      payload, listens on port 4444, and has a timeout of 60 seconds. This command
      is typically used for penetration testing and security assessments to deploy
      payloads on target systems.
