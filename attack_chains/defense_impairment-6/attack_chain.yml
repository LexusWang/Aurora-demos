    description: |-
      This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. 
       Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. 
       This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084.

      Inject a DLL via a reflective loader.
      Listen for a connection. First, the port will need to be knocked fromthe IP defined in KHOST. This IP will work as an authentication method(you can spoof it with tools like hping). After that you could get yourshellcode from any IP. The socket will appear as "closed," thus helping tohide the shellcode
