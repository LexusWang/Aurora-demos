    description: |-
      This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. 
       No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!
