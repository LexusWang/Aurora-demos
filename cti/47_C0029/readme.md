| 08f66886-0e96-455b-be31-b0af37db8e23 | Set a universal payload handler using MSF exploit/multi/handler module | In Metasploit, the exploit/multi/handler module is essentially a universal payload handler.<br>Unlike most exploit modules in Metasploit that target specific vulnerabilities, multi/handler does not exploit a particular service or software.<br>Instead, its main purpose is to listen for incoming connections from payloads that you have already delivered to a target by some other means. |
| 0e67b73a-9927-43e1-8f64-04d38f1db57d | Build Sliver implant (for Windows) | The command is used in the Sliver C2 (Command and Control) framework to generate a payload designed for remote access to a target machine. |

| 1f401bbe-de24-41d2-8e34-d026e25bfb94 | Execute a Sliver Implant Payload | Executing a Sliver implant payload will establish a Sliver session. |
| 861580a4-aad7-4269-94ea-43f3f775423d | Metasploit Payload Execution using Sliver | The command is used within a Sliver session to execute a Metasploit payload in the current process. It allows users to specify various options such as the encoder type, number of encoding iterations, listening host and port, payload type, and command timeout. By default, it uses the "meterpreter_reverse_https" payload, listens on port 4444, and has a timeout of 60 seconds. This command is typically used for penetration testing and security assessments to deploy payloads on target systems. |
| b9fe1645-bc7e-4743-86dc-7dbee3431e16 | Execute Payload windows-meterpreter_reverse_http | None |

Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. <br> This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084. |

The vulnerability is caused by the .htaccess file not preventing the execution of .pht, .phar, and .xhtml files. Files with these extensions are not included in the .htaccess blacklist, hence these files can be uploaded and executed to achieve remote code execution. In this module, a .phar file with a randomized name is uploaded and executed to receive a Meterpreter session on the target, then deletes itself afterwards. |
