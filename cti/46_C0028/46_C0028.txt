During the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, the Sandworm Team initiated their campaign by gaining initial access through phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office attachments with macros, which automatically executed to deploy the BlackEnergy malware. To establish persistence, they created privileged domain accounts and installed a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor. The actors leveraged valid accounts to escalate privileges, move laterally across the corporate and ICS networks via VPNs and dual-homed systems, and used tools like IT helpdesk software to manipulate ICS devices. For command and control, communication occurred over HTTP post requests and port 443, while an internal proxy was set up to facilitate covert operations.
The attackers employed multiple evasion tactics, including modifying registry settings to lower security, deleting malicious files after execution, and using rundll32.exe to proxy malware execution. They further disabled defenses by overwriting firmware on serial-to-ethernet converters, rendering devices inoperable and blocking command, reporting, and serial communication. Data collection involved a BlackEnergy keylogger and network sniffer to capture credentials transmitted between LAN and ICS systems.
In the final stages, the team executed disruptive actions by issuing unauthorized commands via HMI GUIs to open power breakers, triggering widespread blackouts. They amplified the impact by scheduling UPS shutdowns, launching denial-of-service attacks on phone lines, and deploying KillDisk to destroy critical recovery infrastructure. These coordinated efforts resulted in a six-hour power outage, loss of operator control, and significant financial and operational damage, showcasing a sophisticated blend of cyber and physical sabotage.
