通用场景
In the Night Dragon operation, the attacker purchased the managed service for C2 (Command and Control) and used the HTTP protocol for communication. They used Cain & Abel to crack the password hash and achieved full remote control and command-line operation of the infected machine through zwShell. Furthermore, they also invaded the Web server for use as C2 and collected files and data from the victimized systems.



The attacker copied the files to the company's Web server and downloaded them. They also used the dynamic DNS service as the C2 channel and exploited the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to steal the email archive data. By injecting SQL into external websites, they further penetrate the target system. Furthermore, they used the compromised VPN accounts to access the internal network and used the company's external network server as a backup C2.



zwShell is frequently used to browse file systems and operate the registry. In some cases, the attackers also disabled the anti-virus software and anti-espionage tools on the target host and turned off the proxy Settings, enabling the victim host to directly connect to the Internet. They also used system management tools to remotely transmit Trojan components, utilized shelling technology to hide the features of the tools, and employed DLLS containing XOR encoding segments.



They use Trojan programs from underground forums and tools such as gsecdump to obtain account hash information. They induce users to click on malicious links through phishing emails, thereby downloading malicious software. They also uploaded common hacking tools to the compromised Web server and used cracking and hash passing tools to obtain usernames and passwords, thereby accessing key internal desktops and servers.
