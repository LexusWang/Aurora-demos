During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, CyberAv3ngers targeted internet-exposed Unitronics Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) with Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), exploiting their frequent use of default credentials like the '1111' password for initial access. After compromising these publicly accessible devices – including OT infrastructure components like cellular modems – the attackers defaced HMIs by replacing operational interfaces with malicious graphics, deliberately obstructing operators' visibility into system status (Loss of View). This sabotage induced a Denial of Service condition that disrupted normal device operations across multiple sectors, with severe cascading effects: victim organizations faced forced operational halts (Loss of Availability) that directly impaired productivity and revenue streams (Loss of Productivity). In one critical instance, the campaign caused a communications failure at a remote pumping station, demonstrating the attackers' ability to escalate digital compromises into tangible physical disruptions.
