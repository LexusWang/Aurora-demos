In the C0021 attack, the threat actor first implemented initial intrusion by sending phishing emails containing unique malicious links to deceive users into clicking, which downloaded a ZIP archive containing a malicious .LNK file. This .LNK file embedded a Base64-encoded payload, which the attacker later decoded using obfuscated PowerShell scripts (including the use of the special string 'FromBase'+0x40+'String' to replace the conventional FromBase64String method). To establish persistent control, the attacker utilized the Cobalt Strike tool with a modified Pandora Malleable C2 configuration file, loading the Beacon DLL via rundll32.exe for stealthy execution.

For infrastructure, the attacker not only registered dedicated domains for C2 communication but also compromised legitimate domains to host malicious payloads for enhanced concealment. C2 communication employed a multi-protocol hybrid strategy, including HTTP, SSL-based TCP port 443, and standard TCP protocols, alongside asymmetric encryption to secure data transmission. Additionally, the attacker deployed additional tools to compromised hosts via Ingress Tool Transfer and continuously uploaded malware to their controlled websites to expand attack capabilities. Throughout the process, the attacker combined domain hijacking, protocol obfuscation, code obfuscation, and multi-layer encryption to execute a complete attack chain from initial infiltration to lateral movement.
