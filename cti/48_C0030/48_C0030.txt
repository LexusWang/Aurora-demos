During the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles began with network reconnaissance to identify targets, followed by developing specialized malware and leveraging tools like Mimikatz and a modified version of cryptcat to encrypt communications and evade detection. They gained initial access via poorly configured OT firewalls and RDP jump boxes using valid credentials, then moved laterally within the ICS environment by transferring tools such as WMImplant via PowerShell and scheduled tasks. To maintain stealth, the actors renamed malicious files to mimic legitimate Windows or Schneider Electric applications and altered cryptcat binaries to reduce antivirus detection.
For credential theft, TEMP.Veles employed adversary-in-the-middle tactics by hijacking phone numbers tied to accounts, redirecting login codes to controlled websites, and capturing credentials during password changes. They further dumped OS credentials from LSASS memory using Mimikatz. Once entrenched, the attackers focused on impairing industrial processes: they injected unauthorized commands into Triconex safety controllers via the Triton malware, triggering a plant shutdown by forcing controllers into a failed safe state. To obscure their tracks, the malware programmatically restored systems to normal states if execution failed, or overwrote malicious code with invalid data.
The attack culminated in a week-long operational halt, severely impacting productivity and revenue. This multi-phase operation combined sophisticated evasion techniques, lateral movement through valid accounts, and precise manipulation of safety systems, highlighting a deliberate focus on disrupting critical industrial infrastructure.
