During C0027, Scattered Spider executed a multi-phase cloud-centric campaign, beginning with the exploitation of CVE-2021-35464 in ForgeRock OpenAM to gain initial access. To establish persistence, they leveraged compromised Azure credentials to authenticate to victim tenants, registered unauthorized MFA devices for VPN access, and created rogue Azure VMs while manipulating AWS IAM roles via aws_consoler to generate temporary federated credentials.
Reconnaissance operations involved systematic Azure AD queries to harvest email addresses, identify privileged cloud accounts, and bulk-download group membership data with Active Directory attributes. This intelligence was augmented by credential theft through SMS phishing, voice impersonation of IT staff directing victims to fake portals, and MFA fatigue attacks spamming push notifications until acceptance.
For lateral movement, attackers utilized stolen Azure credentials to pivot to on-premises systems, employed WMI via Impacket, and deployed the rsocx reverse proxy on ESXi appliances after scanning networks with RustScan. Data collection targeted organizational repositories, with OneDrive and SharePoint systematically mined for VPN configurations, MFA enrollment guides, and help desk procedures.
Operational infrastructure relied heavily on living-off-the-land techniques: they downloaded tools like LINpeas and Level RMM from platforms including GitHub and file.io, while using SSH tunneling and commercial RMM tools for C2. To obscure activities, they created deceptive cloud instances and weaponized legitimate services, notably impersonating IT personnel via phone calls and Telegram messages to manipulate victims into executing malicious workflows.
The campaign culminated in DCSync attacks for domain replication, demonstrating tight integration of cloud API abuse, social engineering, and hybrid network exploitation to bypass modern defenses.
