| be8e1965-514d-4713-be63-2accf8a6e717 | Intelliants Subrion CMS 4.2.1 - Authenticated File Upload Bypass to RCE | This module exploits an authenticated file upload vulnerability in Subrion CMS versions 4.2.1 and lower. The vulnerability is caused by the .htaccess file not preventing the execution of .pht, .phar, and .xhtml files. Files with these extensions are not included in the .htaccess blacklist, hence these files can be uploaded and executed to achieve remote code execution. In this module, a .phar file with a randomized name is uploaded and executed to receive a Meterpreter session on the target, then deletes itself afterwards. |
| 8887a435-939a-4d9b-bcdc-75eb3877bca9 | Samba "username map script" Command Execution | This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. <br> No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication! |

| de6091de-bce3-456d-bf1e-0a88936f06ed | ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability | This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. <br> Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. <br> This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084. |
| c53be697-994f-44ec-b052-3509dda2c489 | Windows Command Shell, Hidden Bind TCP Stager | Spawn a piped command shell (staged).<br>Listen for a connection from a hidden port and spawn a command shell to the allowed host. |
| 2d5a61f5-0447-4be4-944a-1f8530ed6574 | Remote System Discovery - arp | Identify remote systems via arp. <br><br>Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will execute arp to list out the arp cache. Output will be via stdout. |

| de6091de-bce3-456d-bf1e-0a88936f06ed | ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability | This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. <br> Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. <br> This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084. |
