During the C0032 campaign, TEMP.Veles leveraged Virtual Private Servers (VPS) as infrastructure while employing compromised VPN accounts for initial access and persistence. They maintained footholds through Image File Execution Options registry modifications and scheduled task XML triggers, while deploying web shells on Exchange servers for redundant access. For defense evasion, attackers systematically deleted logs/tools, performed timestomping via PowerShell to alter file metadata ($STANDARD_INFORMATION), and masqueraded malicious files as legitimate Windows updates or Schneider Electric applications. Credential harvesting was achieved using Mimikatz and their custom SecHack tool to dump LSASS memory. Data aggregation occurred through hidden staging folders before exfiltration via encrypted SSH tunnels (PLINK) and non-standard ports (443/4444/8531/50501) with port-protocol mismatches. Lateral movement relied heavily on RDP and SSH connections, facilitated by stolen credentials. Throughout operations, they utilized tools like PsExec while maintaining stealth through layered techniques - combining legitimate Windows features abuse, encrypted C2 channels, and systematic forensic countermeasures.
