During the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team executed a multi-phase campaign beginning with credential access through brute-force RPC authentication attempts and PowerShell-based in-memory credential harvesting. They established persistence by creating domain accounts ("admin" and "система") with elevated privileges, manipulating SQL Server logins via sp_addlinkedsrvlogin, and deploying a trojanized Windows Notepad to sustain Industroyer malware. System processes were subverted through Windows Service modifications and registry manipulation to load backdoor binaries at boot.
For lateral movement, attackers utilized valid accounts across VPNs and dual-homed systems, transferring tools via network shares using both native commands (move/net use) and VBS scripts that copied ICS payloads between directories. MS-SQL served as a pivot point for network-wide code execution, leveraging stored procedures like xp_cmdshell and SQL-linked accounts.
Defense evasion involved layered techniques: event logging was disabled, files were masqueraded as .txt documents and ICS protocol-named executables, while UPX-packed Mimikatz and heavily obfuscated Industroyer components avoided detection. Credential harvesting culminated with LSASS memory dumping using Mimikatz. Scripting formed the operational backbone, with VBS/PowerShell/batch scripts enabling remote WMI execution, file operations, and system reconnaissance through Active Directory LDAP queries.
The attack chain demonstrated tight integration of living-off-the-land binaries (e.g., cscript) with custom malware, using command-line interfaces to deploy payloads while maintaining infrastructure awareness through network connectivity checks and AD enumeration.
