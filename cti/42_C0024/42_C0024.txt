The SolarWinds compromise orchestrated by APT29 began with a supply chain attack, embedding the SUNBURST malware into trojanized SolarWinds Orion updates (T1195.002) and exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-0688 (T1190). After initial access, attackers used PowerShell and cmd.exe (T1059.001/003) for remote command execution and lateral movement via RDP, SMB, and WinRM (T1021.001/002/006). Privilege escalation involved manipulating domain federation trusts (T1484.002) to forge SAML tokens (T1606.002), granting unauthorized access to cloud services. Persistence was maintained through scheduled tasks masquerading as legitimate processes (T1053.005), while defense evasion tactics included disabling logging (T1562.002/004), timestomping files (T1070.006), and substituting legitimate utilities like rundll32.exe (T1218.011). Credential theft targeted Chrome passwords (T1555.003), Kerberos tickets (T1558.003), and AD FS private keys (T1552.004), with data collection spanning emails (T1114.002), source code repositories (T1213.003), and internal wikis (T1213). Collected data was compressed using 7-Zip (T1560.001) and exfiltrated via HTTPS (T1048.002), while command and control (T1071.001) leveraged HTTP and dynamic DNS (T1568). APT29 further obscured infrastructure by mimicking victim hostnames (T1665) and employing SSH tunneling (T1090.001), showcasing a layered strategy combining supply chain exploitation, credential abuse, and advanced evasion to maintain prolonged access.
