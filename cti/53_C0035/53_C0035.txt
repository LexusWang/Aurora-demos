The KV Botnet Activity involved a multi-layered attack targeting SOHO network devices, utilizing Virtual Private Servers (VPS) as command-and-control infrastructure. Attackers deployed Bash scripts during botnet installation stages and modified file permissions to enable payload execution, while disguising processes under names like pr_set_mm_exe_file and [kworker/0:1] to evade detection. To maintain persistence, they leveraged libevent to monitor and terminate specific processes (e.g., busybox, curl) unless referencing bioset. The botnetâ€™s C2 communication employed a custom protocol over random high-numbered ports (>30,000), with encrypted negotiation mimicking TLS. Discovery activities included gathering system data (e.g., IP addresses, file directories, CPU usage) using tools like uname and removing security software (http_watchdog, firewallsd). Finally, the payload operated in memory via /proc/ binding, deleting disk artifacts to minimize forensic traces.
