For C0026, the threat actors first re-registered expired C2 domains and a ClouDNS dynamic DNS subdomain previously associated with the ANDROMEDA malware to reestablish infrastructure. They then collected documents from compromised hosts, specifically using WinRAR to archive files created after January 1, 2021, for targeted data theft. To facilitate stealthy exfiltration, the actors split encrypted archives containing stolen data into 3MB parts, adhering to size limits during transfer. Additionally, malicious payloads were downloaded onto selected compromised hosts, further expanding their control over the targeted systems. This multi-stage approach combined infrastructure reuse, selective data collection, and evasion tactics to execute the campaign.
