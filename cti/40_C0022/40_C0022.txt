In Operation Dream Job, the Lazarus Group orchestrated a multi-phase attack beginning with extensive reconnaissance, leveraging LinkedIn and social media to identify targets and gather organizational roles. To establish initial access, they deployed spearphishing via emails (with malicious attachments or OneDrive links) and LinkedIn messages impersonating HR personnel, luring victims with fake job offers. Upon execution, malicious documents (disguised as JPEGs or containing VBA macros) extracted double Base64-encoded DLL implants or triggered remote XSL script downloads via WMIC.
For persistence, the group utilized registry run keys, startup folder LNK files, and scheduled tasks. They exploited PowerShell, Windows Command Shell, and native APIs like ObtainUserAgentString to explore environments, launch malware, and evade detection. Custom tools like DRATzarus and Sumarta (packed with Themida, encrypted via XOR/base64) were digitally signed with stolen Sectigo RSA certificates to bypass security controls.
Infrastructure-wise, Lazarus registered domains mimicking victim companies and compromised servers in Italy, hosting malware on platforms like Dropbox and OneDrive. C2 communication relied on HTTP/HTTPS with AES encryption, while exfiltration occurred via cloud storage (using modified dbxcli) and direct C2 channels. Defense evasion tactics included file deletion, sandbox detection via system checks (e.g., GetTickCount), and masquerading malicious files.
Throughout the campaign, Lazarus blended social engineering (fake LinkedIn/email accounts) with technical sophistication—targeting IIS servers, brute-forcing admin accounts, and filtering victim data by language settings—to exfiltrate sensitive financial and security-related documents archived into RAR files. This operation exemplifies their hybrid approach of psychological manipulation, infrastructure abuse, and layered obfuscation to achieve long-term access and data theft.
