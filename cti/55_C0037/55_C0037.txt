Water Curupiraâ€™s Pikabot distribution relied on spearphishing emails delivering password-protected ZIP files or IMG attachments containing obfuscated JavaScript or malicious LNK/DLL files. Users were lured into executing these files, triggering cmd.exe or rundll32.exe (via exports like Crash or Limit) to deploy the payload. The campaign spoofed email threads to impersonate legitimate conversations and used curl.exe to fetch Pikabot from external servers. Heavy JavaScript obfuscation and system binary abuse (rundll32.exe) further masked malicious activity, requiring user interaction to complete the infection chain.
