The HomeLand Justice campaign exploited CVE-2019-0604 in Microsoft SharePoint for initial access, deploying .aspx web shells (e.g., pickers.aspx) for persistence. Threat actors impersonated tokens (ImpersonateLoggedOnUser) and abused compromised Exchange accounts, granting themselves ApplicationImpersonation privileges to hijack mailboxes and discover administrator accounts via PowerShell (New-MailboxSearch). Lateral movement leveraged RDP and SMB, while tools like Mimikatz dumped LSASS credentials and Impacket facilitated privilege escalation. Defense evasion included disabling EDR solutions, deleting logs, and masquerading malware (e.g., renaming ROADSWEEP to GoXML.exe). Final impact involved encrypting systems with ROADSWEEP ransomware and wiping disks via ZeroCleare, propagated using Mellona.exe across internal machines.
