The Versa Director Zero Day Exploitation exploited CVE-2024-39717 to compromise servers, deploying the custom VersaMem web shell for command and control. Attackers routed communications through compromised SOHO devices, initializing C2 via non-standard TCP sessions before establishing encrypted HTTPS channels. Credentials were harvested by intercepting user logins, while persistence relied on VersaMem to maintain access. Reconnaissance focused on mapping network services, aligning with the attackers' use of Advanced Port Scanner in related campaigns.
