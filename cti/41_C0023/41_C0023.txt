In Operation Ghost, APT29 meticulously prepared its infrastructure by registering domains mimicking legitimate entities and leveraging Twitter accounts to host covert command-and-control (C2) nodes. To infiltrate target networks, the group deployed custom malware strains such as FatDuke, MiniDuke, RegDuke, and PolyglotDuke, while employing steganography to conceal both C2 communications and malicious payloads within innocuous image files. For persistence, APT29 utilized Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions to ensure malware longevity on compromised systems. Additionally, the actors exploited stolen administrator credentials to facilitate lateral movement across domains, blending their activities with legitimate traffic. To further enhance stealth, bidirectional communication channels were established via social media platforms, enabling discreet data exfiltration and C2 operations. This operation highlights APT29â€™s reliance on layered obfuscation, trusted protocol abuse, and hybrid infrastructure to maintain undetected access and operational flexibility.
