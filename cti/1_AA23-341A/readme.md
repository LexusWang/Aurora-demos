The following attack chains are generated to mimic the attack behaviors in report.


## desktop_context_switched-1
Among our available attack actions, this attack chain most closely matches the CTI report. The following table shows the specific attack actions in the chain whose tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are mentioned in the original attack report.

| uuid | name | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 08f66886-0e96-455b-be31-b0af37db8e23 | Set a universal payload handler using MSF exploit/multi/handler module | In Metasploit, the exploit/multi/handler module is essentially a universal payload handler.<br>Unlike most exploit modules in Metasploit that target specific vulnerabilities, multi/handler does not exploit a particular service or software.<br>Instead, its main purpose is to listen for incoming connections from payloads that you have already delivered to a target by some other means. |
| 0e67b73a-9927-43e1-8f64-04d38f1db57d | Build Sliver implant (for Windows) | The command is used in the Sliver C2 (Command and Control) framework to generate a payload designed for remote access to a target machine. |
| 19301991-c518-46ca-a622-378e1be4f1ad | Simulate the victim download and execute malicious payload file as Admin (Root) | None |
| 1f401bbe-de24-41d2-8e34-d026e25bfb94 | Execute a Sliver Implant Payload | Executing a Sliver implant payload will establish a Sliver session. |
| 861580a4-aad7-4269-94ea-43f3f775423d | Metasploit Payload Execution using Sliver | The command is used within a Sliver session to execute a Metasploit payload in the current process. It allows users to specify various options such as the encoder type, number of encoding iterations, listening host and port, payload type, and command timeout. By default, it uses the "meterpreter_reverse_https" payload, listens on port 4444, and has a timeout of 60 seconds. This command is typically used for penetration testing and security assessments to deploy payloads on target systems. |
| b9fe1645-bc7e-4743-86dc-7dbee3431e16 | Execute Payload windows-meterpreter_reverse_http | None |
| 7d5e9f3a-8b2c-41a3-9c8d-f1e9b3a7c2e1 | Enumerate Desktops | The `enumdesktops` command lists available desktop sessions on Windows systems. |
| b5c3d9a2-7e4f-4a1d-8c3b-6f2e5a1d0b9c | Desktop Context Switching | The `setdesktop` command switches between desktop contexts. |
