The following attack chains are generated to mimic the attack behaviors in report.


## device_config_modified-1
Among our available attack actions, this attack chain most closely matches the CTI report. The following table shows the specific attack actions in the chain whose tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are mentioned in the original attack report.

| uuid | name | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 08f66886-0e96-455b-be31-b0af37db8e23 | Set a universal payload handler using MSF exploit/multi/handler module | In Metasploit, the exploit/multi/handler module is essentially a universal payload handler.<br>Unlike most exploit modules in Metasploit that target specific vulnerabilities, multi/handler does not exploit a particular service or software.<br>Instead, its main purpose is to listen for incoming connections from payloads that you have already delivered to a target by some other means. |
| 0e67b73a-9927-43e1-8f64-04d38f1db57d | Build Sliver implant (for Windows) | The command is used in the Sliver C2 (Command and Control) framework to generate a payload designed for remote access to a target machine. |
| 19301991-c518-46ca-a622-378e1be4f1ad | Simulate the victim download and execute malicious payload file as Admin (Root) | None |
| 1f401bbe-de24-41d2-8e34-d026e25bfb94 | Execute a Sliver Implant Payload | Executing a Sliver implant payload will establish a Sliver session. |
| 861580a4-aad7-4269-94ea-43f3f775423d | Metasploit Payload Execution using Sliver | The command is used within a Sliver session to execute a Metasploit payload in the current process. It allows users to specify various options such as the encoder type, number of encoding iterations, listening host and port, payload type, and command timeout. By default, it uses the "meterpreter_reverse_https" payload, listens on port 4444, and has a timeout of 60 seconds. This command is typically used for penetration testing and security assessments to deploy payloads on target systems. |
| b9fe1645-bc7e-4743-86dc-7dbee3431e16 | Execute Payload windows-meterpreter_reverse_http | None |
| e8d934bc-1b12-4460-87b7-b268a63e3a6d | Disable Input Devices | The `uictl` command disables keyboard/mouse input devices for defense evasion. |

## defense_impairment-4
Among our available attack actions, this attack chain most closely matches the CTI report. The following table shows the specific attack actions in the chain whose tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are mentioned in the original attack report.

| uuid | name | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| de6091de-bce3-456d-bf1e-0a88936f06ed | ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability | This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. <br> Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. <br> This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084. |
| c53be697-994f-44ec-b052-3509dda2c489 | Windows Command Shell, Hidden Bind TCP Stager | Spawn a piped command shell (staged).<br>Listen for a connection from a hidden port and spawn a command shell to the allowed host. |
| 1f6743da-6ecc-4a93-b03f-dc357e4b313f | Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe | Disable Windows Defender by tampering with windows defender registry using the utility "reg.exe" |
