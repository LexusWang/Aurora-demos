APT41â€™s DUST campaign utilized serverless infrastructure (Cloudflare Workers) and compromised Google Workspace accounts for C2 via HTTPS. Persistence was achieved through rogue Windows services (Windows Defend) and web shells (ANTSWORD), while DLL search order hijacking and side-loading (via AhnLab uninstallers) executed DUSTTRAP. Data collected from Oracle databases using SQLULDR2 was staged locally, compressed with rar, and exfiltrated to OneDrive. Attackers masked DUSTPAN as legitimate processes (w3wp.exe) and employed stolen code-signing certificates to evade detection, deleting artifacts post-exfiltration to minimize traces.
