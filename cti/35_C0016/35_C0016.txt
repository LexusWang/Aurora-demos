During Operation Dust Storm, the threat actors established domains as part of their operational infrastructure and registered them using specifically created email addresses. They made use of dynamic DNS services from a variety of free providers, including No-IP, Oray, and 3322, to enhance the resilience of their command-and-control infrastructure.

The attackers utilized a combination of Visual Basic scripts and JavaScript code, and in some cases, employed VBS code to decode payloads. They also executed JavaScript via mshta.exe, further leveraging scripting capabilities during the operation.

For initial compromise, the threat actors conducted a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller's website to exploit the then-zero-day Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2014-0322. In addition, they exploited multiple other vulnerabilities, including Adobe Flash CVE-2011-0611, Microsoft Windows Help CVE-2010-1885, and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities CVE-2011-1255, CVE-2012-1889, and again CVE-2014-0322.

To gain initial access, they sent spearphishing emails that either contained a malicious Microsoft Word document or embedded a malicious link. The success of these tactics relied on victims opening the malicious documents or clicking the links delivered via email.

Prior to delivering the exploits, the attackers deployed a script named DeployJava.js to fingerprint installed software on victim systems. In terms of payload delivery, they disguised some executable files as JPG images and packed others using UPX. Moreover, some payloads were encoded using single-byte XOR, with efforts to avoid key exposure by skipping and zeroing the key, while others were simply Base64-encoded.
