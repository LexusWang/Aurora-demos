During Operation Spalax, threat actors registered hundreds of domains, using Duck DNS and DNS Exit, integrating these dynamic DNS services into their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.   They employed Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) scripts to install malware and used a variety of packers and droppers to decrypt malicious payloads  To further obfuscate their operations, the actors used packers such as CyaX, which involved reading pixel data from images to build the next layer of execution.   They also used XOR-encrypted payloads to evade detection.

The threat actors obtained malware including Remcos, njRAT, and AsyncRAT, and carried out phishing campaigns with emails containing malicious links or PDF attachments.   Malicious files and malware were distributed through trusted hosting services like OneDrive and MediaFire.   To execute the malware, they used rundll32.exe to launch malicious installers and relied on social engineering to convince victims to click on malicious links or open PDF files with embedded malicious links, triggering the download and execution of malware.   The actors also used droppers that performed anti-analysis checks before executing the malicious payloads on compromised hosts.
