| de6091de-bce3-456d-bf1e-0a88936f06ed | ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability | This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run, which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. <br> Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt. <br> This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084. |

| 861580a4-aad7-4269-94ea-43f3f775423d | Metasploit Payload Execution using Sliver | The command is used within a Sliver session to execute a Metasploit payload in the current process. It allows users to specify various options such as the encoder type, number of encoding iterations, listening host and port, payload type, and command timeout. By default, it uses the "meterpreter_reverse_https" payload, listens on port 4444, and has a timeout of 60 seconds. This command is typically used for penetration testing and security assessments to deploy payloads on target systems. |
