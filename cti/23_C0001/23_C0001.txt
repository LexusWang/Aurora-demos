During Frankenstein, the threat actors used HTTP GET requests for C2 communications. They used Empire to automatically gather the username, domain name, machine name, and other system information. Information collected via Empire was automatically sent back to the adversary's C2. PowerShell was employed to run a series of Base64-encoded commands that acted as a stager and enumerated hosts. To establish persistence, they executed command scripts and created scheduled tasks named "WinUpdate", often using encoded command-line instructions.

The actors used malicious Word documents that prompted victims to enable macros, which executed embedded Visual Basic scripts. Empire was further used to collect a variety of local system data and enumerate hosts, processes, administrative privileges, and machine details. Following script execution, they deobfuscated Base64-encoded commands to reveal small scripts designed to fetch additional payloads. Communication with C2 also involved encrypted RC4 byte streams and AES-CBC.

Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 allowed them to execute code on victim machines. They downloaded various files and tools, and employed trojanized documents that retrieved remote templates from adversary-controlled websites. MSBuild was used to execute actor-created files, and macros were again relied upon for execution via spearphishing emails containing Microsoft Word documents.

Empire was also used to determine public IP addresses and identify the compromised host. The group established persistence using scheduled task commands such as: /Create /F /SC DAILY /ST 09:00 /TN WinUpdate /TR, consistently naming tasks "WinUpdate". WMI queries were used extensively — to detect analysis tools, check for VMs or sandboxes (e.g., VMware and VirtualBox), and gather system specifications such as core count. Execution would be halted if less than two cores were detected. They also used WMI to check for security tools and determine the OS version.
