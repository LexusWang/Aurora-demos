The PROMETHIUM group deployed the StrongPity malware during C0033 by compromising the official Syrian E-Gov website to distribute a maliciously modified legitimate application through a drive-by download. Once installed, StrongPity established persistence by triggering on system events such as device boot-ups, screen interactions, or connectivity changes, while evading detection through code obfuscation and disabling security tools via altered permissions on rooted devices. The malware performed extensive data collection, including call logs, SMS messages, contact lists, audio recordings, device locations, installed software, file directories, Wi-Fi network details, and system information such as SIM serial numbers. It also monitored notifications from multiple applications to harvest credentials and sensitive data. Communication with command-and-control (C2) servers occurred over encrypted HTTPS channels, enabling both file transfers for further execution and the exfiltration of encrypted stolen data. By masquerading as benign software and leveraging layered encryption, the operation demonstrated a comprehensive approach to mobile espionage and data theft.
