During the 2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, the Sandworm Team employed a multi-stage offensive leveraging PowerShell, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and Systemd configurations. They initiated the attack using the TANKTRAP PowerShell utility to propagate a wiper via Windows Group Policy while deploying the Neo-REGEORG web shell on internet-facing servers for persistence. To ensure continued execution, they created Systemd services masquerading as legitimate processes, configured Scheduled Tasks via GPOs to trigger CaddyWiper at specific times, and mapped a malicious ISO image (a.iso) to a SCADA virtual machine, exploiting autorun functionality to execute a VBS script. Lateral movement was achieved by copying CaddyWiper’s executable (msserver.exe) across systems using GPOs. For defense evasion, they abused GPOs for malware deployment and concealed C2 traffic within TLS-based tunnels, including the GOGETTER tunneler establishing a “Yamux” protocol channel. Ultimately, the attackers targeted operational technology (OT) infrastructure by executing unauthorized SCADA commands via the scilc.exe binary, triggered through scripts (lun.vbs and n.bat), culminating in data destruction across IT environments and substation disruption using CaddyWiper. This coordinated effort combined IT network compromise, lateral propagation, and OT system manipulation to maximize operational impact.
