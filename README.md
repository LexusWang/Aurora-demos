# Aurora-demos: 
This projects contains the attack chains generated by Aurora, an semi-automated cyber attack construction framework.

Aurora is a framework that can construct multi-step cyberattacks (attack chains).
With the help of LLM, it makes use of external attack tools and threat intelligence reports.

We are preparing publishing the source code of Aurora.

## üéâ Introduction
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928"><img alt="Paper thumbnail" align="right" width="160" src="images/First_page.png"></a></p>

- Introduces AURORA, a PDDL-based cyberattack simulation system.
- Integrates LLMs into PDDL for real-world BAS.
- Automates construction of a 1,800+ action attack space with over 300 chains.
- AURORA generates higher quality attack plans with broader TTP coverage.
