Royal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a specific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if the victim does not pay the ransom.

Initial Access
Royal actors gain initial access to victim networks in several ways including:

Phishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of incidents) gain initial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566].
According to open source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that delivers Royal ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF documents [T1566.001], and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The second most common vector Royal actors use (in 13.3% of incidents) for initial access is RDP compromise.  
Public-facing applications. FBI has also observed Royal threat actors gain initial access through exploiting public-facing applications [T1190]. 
Brokers. Reports from trusted third-party sources indicate that Royal threat actors may leverage brokers to gain initial access and source traffic by harvesting virtual private network (VPN) credentials from stealer logs. 
Command and Control
Once Royal actors gain access to a network, they communicate with command and control (C2) infrastructure and download multiple tools [T1105]. Legitimate Windows software is repurposed by Royal operators to strengthen their foothold within the victim’s network. Ransomware operators often use open source projects to aid their intrusion activities—Royal operators have recently been observed using Chisel, a tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to communicate with their C2 infrastructure. FBI observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal ransomware attacks but is yet to determine if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s.

Lateral Movement and Persistence
Royal threat actors often use RDP to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. Microsoft Sysinternals tool PsExec has also been used to aid lateral movement. FBI observed Royal threat actors using remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and Atera for persistence in the victim’s network [T1133]. In some instances, the threat actors moved laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed case, the threat actors used a legitimate admin account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once on the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001].

Exfiltration
Royal threat actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike and malware tools and derivatives such as Ursnif/Gozi for data aggregation and exfiltration. According to third-party reporting, Royal threat actors’ first hop in exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S. IP address.

Note: In reference to Cobalt Strike and other tools mentioned above, a tool repository used by Royal was identified at IP: 94.232.41[.]105 in December 2022.

Encryption
Before starting the encryption process, Royal threat actors:

Use Windows Restart Manager to determine whether targeted files are currently in use or blocked by other applications [T1486].[1]
Use Windows Volume Shadow Copy service (vssadmin.exe) to delete shadow copies to inhibit system recovery.[1] 
FBI has found numerous batch (.bat) files on impacted systems which are typically transferred as an encrypted 7zip file. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs [T1070.001].

Malicious files have been found in victim networks in the following directories:

C:\Temp\
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\
C:\Users\<users>\
C:\ProgramData\
