APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) is an APT group suspected to originate from South America, primarily targeting Colombia. Since 2018, the group has persistently launched attack campaigns against Colombian entities. Recently, the 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute detected multiple phishing email-based targeted attacks by this group against Colombian national targets. Based on correlations identified through sample decryption algorithms, we attribute both campaigns to the Blind Eagle group. In both attacks, samples employed multi-stage decryption and deployment, increasing the difficulty of traditional detection. APT-C-36 frequently utilizes spear-phishing attacks, impersonating government departments to send malicious emails to victims. Both campaigns described in this report employed email delivery for the initial payload. The first campaign masqueraded as a DHL package delivery notification, using a shipping notice theme to deceive targets. The second delivery impersonated a government email, sending a malicious document disguised as a PDF file. Blind Eagle maintains high focus on Colombian government departments, often impersonating relevant agencies in email deliveries and mimicking government websites for phishing attacks. Latin America itself comprises complex national compositions, vast geography, and diverse cultural customs. The rising influence of left-wing forces in recent years has impacted South America's political landscape. As a strategic partner of the United States, Colombia assists in advancing US global strategy and maintaining regional stability within Latin America through its status and influence, attracting close scrutiny from nations with differing political views. Amidst turmoil and political divisions across South American nations, targeted intelligence theft attacks are widespread. These APT attacks exhibit persistence and clear targeting; even after disclosure by security vendors, they do not cease operations but lie dormant, requiring constant vigilance. Phishing emails remain a critical entry vector for APT attacks. Most users lack strong security awareness and are easily deceived by spoofed emails, disguised documents, and misleading subject lines, leading to compromise without warning.
