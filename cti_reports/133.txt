Hackers Exploit LinkedIn Recruitment for Targeted Cyber Attacks  
ESET recently exposed a suspected targeted attack campaign by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, which primarily involves searching for target companies on LinkedIn, identifying employees within these organizations, and initiating private chats under the guise of recruitment. Once the target shows interest, attackers tailor their responses to the victim's location and deliver malicious files via LinkedIn when further inquiries are made. The attackers frequently suggest switching platforms like Skype, using scripted phrases such as "If you wish the information,I can send it to you" with identical punctuation across multiple conversations, indicating copied templates. To bypass detection, password-protected malicious files are distributed, potentially evading LinkedIn's security scans. Alternatively, attackers directly send encrypted ZIP archives containing malicious LNK files to targets' publicly listed emails. Executing these files triggers malicious code that displays decoy recruitment documents while creating scheduled tasks to deploy persistent backdoor modules.

Post-compromise, attackers exploit victims' resources, exemplified by a case where hijacked email accounts were used to request fraudulent payments from clients. Similar risks apply to domestic LinkedIn counterpart Maimai, requiring vigilance against suspicious resume attachments, particularly in HR departments.
