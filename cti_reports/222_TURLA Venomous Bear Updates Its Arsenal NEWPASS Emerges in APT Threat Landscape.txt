TURLA Venomous Bear Updates Its Arsenal NEWPASS Emerges in APT Threat Landscape
Recent analysis by Telsy has identified artifacts linked to June 2020 attacks, likely associated with the Russian APT group known as Venomous Bear (Turla/Uroburos). The threat actors employed a previously unseen implant internally designated as "NewPass," referencing a data exfiltration parameter in C2 communications. Telsy assesses this implant has targeted at least one EU nation's diplomatic sector. NewPass constitutes sophisticated malware comprising multiple components that exchange encoded configuration files, including a dropper (SHA256: e1741e02d9387542cc809f747c78d5a352e7682a9b83cbe210c09e2241af6078), loader, and agent modules. The dropper employs anti-analysis techniques by using LocalDataVer as its entry point instead of standard DLL functions, deploying payloads to隐蔽 paths mimicking legitimate software (ProgramData\Adobe\ARM\Reader_20.021.210_47.dat and WindowsHolographic\SpatialStore). Loader components (lib3DXquery.dll: 6e730ea7b38ea80f2e852781f0a96e0bb16ebed8793a5ea4902e94c594bb6ae0, WindowsHolographicService.dll: f966ef66d0510da597fec917451c891480a785097b167c6a7ea130cf1e8ff514) utilize XOR decryption with key 19 B9 20 5A B8 EF 2D A3 73 08 C1 53 to process configuration files containing JSON parameters for persistence mechanisms (service creation as "Adobe Update Module") and agent loading. The final agent payload (LastJournalx32.adf: 08a1c5b9b558fb8e8201b5d3b998d888dd6df37dbf450ce0284d510a7104ad7f) implements covert C2 communication via specially formatted HTTP POST requests using parameters like newpass, server_page, and passdb, with data encrypted via a custom algorithm. The infection chain demonstrates three-stage modular architecture: dropper→loader→agent, with configuration-driven adaptability and legitimate software path spoofing for evasion.
