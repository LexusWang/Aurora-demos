Gamaredon APT Group Continues Targeting Ukrainian Military and Government Personnel with New Backdoor Versions  
The Gamaredon APT group, a Russia-aligned threat actor, primarily targets Ukrainian government officials, opposition party members, and journalists. Amid escalating conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, particularly following Ukraine's public calls for new EU economic sanctions against Russia, bilateral relations have reached a historical low. Recent monitoring by 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute revealed intensified cyberattacks against Ukrainian military personnel, including newly deployed backdoor variants. This article shares new findings alongside historical analysis. Since January 2021, we have collected numerous Gamaredon lure documents exploiting real-time geopolitical issues related to Ukrainian national policies and international relations. These Ukrainian-language documents (Figure 1) are distributed via email, employing template injection techniques to embed malicious template URLs (Figure 3). When opened, Word downloads malicious templates (Figure 2) to execute VBA macros or exploit vulnerabilities. As documented in our previous report "Rare Alliance: First Joint Attack Campaign by Doomsday Legion and Invisible Mole", Gamaredon utilizes VBS scripts, batch files, and SFX archives to deploy persistent backdoors via scheduled tasks or startup entries. While their infrastructure and obfuscation tactics evolve, core attack methodologies remain consistent. In March 2023, 360's telemetry detected new C++-based exe backdoors (test version shown in Figure 4) featuring USB device monitoring and document theft via HardDriveInspector thread. Compared to earlier DLL variants, the exe version implements modular thread execution and adds screenshot capabilities (Figure 5). Initialization routines (termed SetSchedulerTask) involve terminating old processes, cleaning directories, and adding RunOnce registry entries (Figures 6-7). String decryption aligns with DLL versions, though test builds used dynamic memory loading (Figure 8) later removed in production versions (Figure 9). Compilation timestamps indicate rapid testing-to-deployment cycles in early March. Notable changes include transition from hash-based API resolution (Figure 10) to standard import tables (Figure 11). Gamaredon maintains extensive infrastructure primarily hosted in Russia, frequently rotating IPs/domains. Scripts dynamically construct URLs using domain-resolved IPs (Figures 12-13), enabling quick infrastructure shifts. Targets include Ukrainian military personnel with long-term compromises - some victims show infection histories spanning years. Unlike stealth-focused APTs, Gamaredon prioritizes persistence over concealment, rapidly updating components when exposed. Recent C++ backdoor upgrades represent routine arsenal maintenance rather than strategic shifts. Continuous monitoring reveals ongoing campaigns against high-value Ukrainian targets amidst intensifying regional tensions.
