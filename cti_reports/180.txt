Operation Storm Lazarus APT-C-26 Targets Cryptocurrency Sector With MATA Framework
MATA framework is a multi-platform malware framework recently disclosed by Kaspersky, supporting mainstream platforms including Windows, Linux and macOS with multiple attack components. Victims are widely distributed across Poland, Germany, Turkey, Korea, Japan and India, with Kaspersky associating this framework with Lazarus Group. Following MATA's disclosure, 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute tracked related activities through 360 Security Brain, identifying attacks targeting cryptocurrency industry personnel. Telemetry data shows victims primarily in digital currency sector, including trading platforms and individual holders. The attack chain involves weaponizing open-source software commonly used in cryptocurrency industry. Attackers impersonate professionals to infiltrate community networks, delivering malicious toolkits via IM after establishing trust. Compressed archives release trojanized applications and malicious DLLs executing via "rundll32.exe **.dll,UpdateCheck" command, ultimately deploying MATA framework through downloaders and RAT tools. Three spoofed open-source tools were identified: RemoteDesktopOverNetwork (remote assistance), winauth (two-factor authenticator), and Employee-Management-System (HR management). All contain injected commands triggering backdoor execution. MATA deployment involves PowerShell loading scheduler component from remote servers or UAC bypass via registry manipulation (HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command). The framework's downloader uses AES-CBC encrypted payloads with unique per-sample keys, while RAT implements RC4-encrypted C2 communication supporting commands like cmd execution (0x7FC0A4), file operations (0x21279E), and data exfiltration (0x2AFCB2). Novel samples combining scheduler and plugin functionalities were observed, persisting via "WinUsbD" and "wauserv" services. Compilation timestamps matching compromise timelines indicate urgent cryptocurrency theft motives. Social engineering targets include technical support personnel and financial department staff. TTP overlaps with historical Lazarus operations - weaponizing industry-specific tools and tailored social engineering - strongly suggest attribution to this group. Since 2017, Lazarus has shifted focus from traditional finance to cryptocurrency targets. 360 products including Threat Intelligence Cloud and APT Panoramic Radar provide detection coverage for these activities.
