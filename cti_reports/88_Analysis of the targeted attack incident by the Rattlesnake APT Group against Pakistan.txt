Overview
Recently, Antiy CERT discovered a spear-phishing email attack by the SideWinder APT group targeting Pakistan. This APT group is suspected to originate from a South Asian country and has been active since as early as 2012, mainly targeting Pakistan and other countries. In the past two years, several attack campaigns/incidents involving this group have been disclosed by security vendors, as shown in the timeline below.

This incident involved the SideWinder APT group impersonating the Sindh Police Department of Pakistan to send a malicious spear-phishing email to officials in Punjab province. The email subject lines were “Police Emergency Threat Level Standing Operating Procedures” and “Operational Readiness Color Codes.” The email content related to one of South Asia’s recent hot topics, “counter-terrorism,” and included a malicious document attachment named “STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR POLICE EMERGENCY THREAT LEVELS AND COLOR CODES FOR OPERATIONAL READINESS.docx.” The attackers exploited two document vulnerabilities to deliver a trojan, which then downloaded and executed a malicious JS script from a remote server to perform specified malicious actions.

Attack Process
In this incident, the attacker exploited two document vulnerabilities. They used an HTA file for initial malicious file dropping and configuration, leveraged a white-to-black technique (replacing a library file Duser.dll loaded by the trusted file credwiz.exe) to load the malicious payload, and connected to a remote server to receive malicious JS scripts. The detailed attack flow is shown in Figure 2-1.

Once executed, the malicious document triggers the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, displaying a decoy document and downloading and running a file named main.rtf from the following URL:
http://www.punjabpolice.gov.pk.standingoperatingprocedureforemergencythreat.cdn-in.net/images/5491E413/-1/7384/89dfd89e/main.RTF

The decoy document displayed after execution is shown in Figure 3-1.

The main.RTF sample triggers the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability and downloads an HTA file (named final.hta) from the URL below and executes it (see Table 3-3).

The final.hta is an HTML application with the following execution flow:

It first searches for the system file “C:\Windows\System32\credwiz.exe.”

If found, it copies credwiz.exe to “C:\ProgramData\drvr\srvc2.0\” and writes a Duser.dll file in that directory (see Figure 3-2).

It sets “C:\ProgramData\drvr\srvc2.0\credwiz.exe” as a registry auto-start entry.

If the above three steps succeed, it sends an HTTP GET request to “http://cdn-in.net/plugins/-1/7384/true/true/”. If any step fails and causes termination, error info is appended to the URL and sent.

The Duser.dll dropped by final.hta is a malicious file (sample tags in Table 3-4), while credwiz.exe is a legitimate system file. Since credwiz.exe imports Duser.dll during runtime, attackers abuse this mechanism to bypass security software detection.

After credwiz.exe runs, Duser.dll is imported as a dependent file. Once Duser.dll is running, every 10 minutes it sends a GET request to the URL:
https://cdn-list[.]net/1SdYMUrbdAfpgSt3Gv13U8Jca6qOvI4I2Fa1zSCT/-1/7384/43e2a8fa/css (see Figure 3-3),
then decrypts the returned data to obtain a JavaScript script and executes it (see Figure 3-4).

During our analysis, the JS script returned from the server is used to collect system information, which is then combined into JSON format data and sent via HTTP POST request to the following URL (part of the collected information is shown in Figure 3-5). This initial information gathering step is very common in APT attacks, where attackers analyze the received data to determine further actions such as data theft or deploying additional malware.
URL: http://cdn-list.net/1SdYMUrbdAfpgSt3Gv13U8Jca6qOvI4I2Fa1zSCT/-1/7384/134/7e711ada/res/css

The collected information includes:

System account information, permissions, basic system information, hardware information, network adapters.

Antivirus product list, installed programs, system process information.

Processor configuration, operating system information, time zone, patch information.

File directory listing.

Summary
The SideWinder organization is a relatively active APT group over the past two years. Their main targets are Pakistan and neighboring countries. Their attack method involves English phishing emails themed on military borders between India, China, and Pakistan, delivering malicious payloads via phishing emails for data theft. The group is highly skilled in using N-day vulnerabilities, PowerShell, code obfuscation, and open-source weaponized code. Reports also mention Android malware associated with this group. Based on publicly available vendor information and geopolitical analysis, this group likely originates from a South Asian country. No links have been found so far to threat actors like White Elephant, but it cannot be ruled out that they share the same attack background or are a new attack group or branch.
