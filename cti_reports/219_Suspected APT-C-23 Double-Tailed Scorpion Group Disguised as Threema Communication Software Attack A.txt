Suspected APT-C-23 (Double-Tailed Scorpion) Group Disguised as Threema Communication Software Attack Analysis  
APT-C-23 (Double-Tailed Scorpion), also known as AridViper, Micropsia, FrozenCell, or Desert Falcon, primarily targets educational institutions, military agencies, and critical sectors in Middle Eastern countries, especially Palestinian entities, focusing on sensitive information theft. The group possesses cross-platform attack capabilities targeting both Windows and Android systems. Since May 2016, it has conducted organized, planned, and persistent attacks against Palestinian educational and military institutions. The Android payloads feature geolocation, SMS interception, call recording, and collection of documents, images, contacts, and messages. Windows payloads harvest user data for exfiltration, remote file downloads, and C2 operations. Backdoors are disguised as documents, media players, chat applications, or industry-specific software, delivered via spear-phishing or watering hole attacks combined with social engineering tactics. Historically, APT-C-23 used VC/Delphi-based malware, but this campaign marks a shift towards leveraging commercial RAT components, possibly indicating tactical evolution or new subgroup involvement. Initial detection traced to a decoy document titled "تسريب-اجتماع-القائد-محمد-دحلان-و-المخابرات-المصريه.pdf" (Mohammed Dahlan Commander and Egyptian Intelligence Meeting Leak), referencing a prominent Palestinian political figure. The attack chain deployed Houdini RAT masquerading as Threema, a Swiss end-to-end encrypted messaging app. Houdini RAT, linked to Algerian developer njq8 (associated with njw0rm/njRAT), exhibits capabilities including dynamic DNS configuration, file operations, process enumeration, command execution, and persistence mechanisms. This marks the first observed Houdini RAT usage in APT-C-23 operations. The group continues exploiting regional geopolitical tensions, notably leveraging Palestinian election-related themes in 2023. Social engineering via disguised applications remains a key infiltration vector, capitalizing on low user vigilance to compromise targets and exfiltrate sensitive data.
