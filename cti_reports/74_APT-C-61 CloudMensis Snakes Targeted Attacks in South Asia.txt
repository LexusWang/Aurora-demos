APT-C-61 CloudMensis Snake's Targeted Attacks in South Asia
Since 2020, we have observed activities of a new overseas APT group targeting South Asia, with the earliest traces dating back to January 2020. Designated as APT-C-61 CloudMensis Snake, this group primarily targets critical sectors including government agencies, military-industrial complexes, scientific research institutions, and defense departments in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The group operates independently from known South Asian APT groups like BITTER and SideWinder. CloudMensis Snake employs spear-phishing emails with social engineering tactics to deliver malicious payloads, establishing covert control over targeted devices for persistent sensitive data exfiltration. The group's unique infrastructure relies on cloud services (C2 servers, payload delivery, and data storage) and Python-based malware. The attack chain begins with weaponized documents containing DDE vulnerabilities distributed via phishing emails. Upon execution, PowerShell scripts download multiple malicious modules responsible for payload delivery, persistence mechanisms, and sensitive file scanning/uploading. The group implements two data encryption methods: decimal conversion and Base64 encoding. Malware samples analyzed were PyInstaller-packaged Python scripts communicating with C2 servers hosted on pythonanywhere.com. The RAT functionality includes directory navigation (cd), file download/upload (download/upload), process termination (exit), and command execution via cmd.exe. Notably, the group leverages legitimate tools like 7za.exe and rclone.exe for data compression and exfiltration to Google Drive, evading detection through cloud storage abuse. Forensic analysis of attacker-controlled script files reveals operational patterns dating back to 2020. CloudMensis Snake organizes exfiltrated data in Google Drive directories labeled with country codes: "880" and "BD" (Bangladesh) versus "92" and "TBP" (Pakistan). Timezone analysis (UTC+6:00) and geopolitical context suggest South Asian origins. Distinct from regional APT groups like Donot and BITTER, CloudMensis Snake exhibits unique TTPs including heavy reliance on third-party cloud platforms (Heroku, PythonAnywhere) and novel use of rclone for cloud-based data exfiltration, differing from traditional configuration distribution methods observed in other South Asian campaigns.
