FileCry Ransomware Exposes Low Technical Sophistication 360 Security Brain Neutralizes Its Campaign
Three years after the notorious WannaCry ransomware gained global infamy, numerous copycat ransomware variants have emerged attempting to replicate its success, yet most failed due to technical incompetence. Recently, 360 Security Brain has intercepted a ransomware strain dubbed "FileCry" that demonstrates comical levels of operational ineptitude. 360 Security Brain's monitoring systems detected this new file-encrypting ransomware named FileCry, which appears to imitate WannaCry's ransom note format and attack methodology. After encrypting victims' files, the ransomware displays a pop-up window demanding payment of 0.035 Bitcoin (approximately Â¥2,258) to the specified wallet address 1KcQUy3sxgs9XC9XwpgmyaSgTfLDSHbk9N, requiring victims to send payment confirmation to file.cry@gmail.com for decryption keys. Analysis reveals that despite its naming similarity to WannaCry, FileCry employs conventional encryption techniques without innovation. The ransomware appends ".filecry" extensions to encrypted files and implements a rudimentary encryption algorithm that simply increments each byte of the victim's file data by 1 in ASCII code before appending the extension. Critical flaws were identified in FileCry's design: the decryption key (HCJE4-XJN6H-UWP54-6TV6Y-9SZDO) remains hardcoded within the ransomware's judgment function, essentially leaving the decryption key embedded within the malware itself. 360 Security Guard has implemented interception mechanisms against this threat, while 360 Decryption Master provides free decryption services for affected users, marking China's first functional decryption solution for FileCry. Security recommendations include installing 360 Security Guard from http:weishi.360.cn/, obtaining software exclusively from trusted sources like 360 Software Manager, and utilizing 360 Decryption Master via lesuobingdu.360.cn for file recovery. The current decryption key remains valid for existing variants. MD5: 4899accb55b148537d9b02232cb665a4 d8f7cc08aec6f3ca5d8a45a02f928b8e
