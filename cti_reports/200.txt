RemRAT Android Spyware Persisting in the Middle East for Years
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Syrian civil war, during which continuous conflicts have resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties, millions displaced, and massive infrastructure damage. The "Battle of Aleppo" (July 19, 2012 - December 22, 2016) stands as one of the bloodiest engagements, representing a strategic turning point where Syrian government forces shifted from defensive to offensive operations. Recent 360 security research identified a new mobile RAT associated with this conflict, disguised using icons from Jabhat al-Nusra's participation. Dubbed RemRAT based on package characteristics, this spyware family first emerged in March 2016 and remains active, distributed through APK sub-packages embedded in functional religious applications. The malware employs three communication methods: MQTT for command control, HTTP for data exfiltration, and TOR proxy support added in newer versions. RemRAT exhibits advanced surveillance capabilities including geolocation tracking, call recording, keylogging, and clipboard monitoring. Victimology analysis shows primary targets in Syria and Iran since late 2016, with ongoing infections indicating persistent focus on Middle Eastern geopolitical interests. Code comparisons reveal evolving tactics including planned TOR-based C2 obfuscation and expanded data collection features. As a long-term operation leveraging religious apps for payload delivery, RemRAT exemplifies targeted cyber espionage activities emerging from regional conflicts.
