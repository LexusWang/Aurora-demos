1 Overview
Since 2012, Antian has been continuously tracking and analyzing cyber attacks targeting the South Asian subcontinent, tracing the attackers’ operations and their behind-the-scenes groups. Over the years, Antian has persistently exposed related attack activities to deter Indian attack organizations. Antian released the report “Dance of the White Elephant—Cyber Attacks from the South Asian Subcontinent” in July 2016 [1]; in December 2017, the report “The Hidden Elephant Herd—Series of Indian Cyber Attack Groups and Operations” [2]; in May 2019, the report “SideWinder APT Group’s Targeted Attacks on South Asian Countries” [3]; and in January 2020, the report “Origami Operation: Cyber Attacks Targeting Military and Political Institutions of Multiple South Asian Countries” [4].

The naming of Indian cyber attack groups is complex mainly because different cybersecurity vendors assign their own names. For example, the “White Elephant” group first named by Antian is also called HangOver, VICEROY TIGER, The Dropping Elephant, Patchwork, Chinastrats, and Maha Grass by other vendors; Kaspersky first discovered the “SideWinder” group, also called T-APT-04 or SideWinder by others; the “Gutworm” group disclosed first by ASERT is also known as APT-C-35, DoNot Team, Lucky Elephant, SectorE02 by others.

The attack group involved in this report was disclosed by Antian in the 2017 “Hidden Elephant Herd” report with its “Bitter Wine” operation. Other vendors call it BITTER, Manlinghua, APT-C-17, T-APT-04, etc. According to Antian’s Chinese naming convention for attack groups, combined with its cyber activity and geopolitical characteristics, Antian officially names this group “Bitter Elephant.” After long-term observation, the group is currently very active, with multiple batches of attacks involving two main categories:

Attackers register multiple domains, set up phishing websites, and conduct email phishing attacks against important domestic institutions. The phishing website URL structures and attack targets align with the characteristics of Bitter Elephant’s domestic phishing attacks exposed in 2019.

Attackers host payloads on compromised websites and implant payloads on target machines via shortcut-format lures (a .NET remote control Trojan unique to this group). By analyzing leaked backend source code and payloads of Bitter Elephant, we roughly reconstructed the backend control details of one commonly used Trojan. Based on analysis and comparison, we believe these attack activities originate from the Bitter Elephant group.

In summary, Antian CERT believes this series of attacks is a recent campaign by the Bitter Elephant group. The main features of this series of related attacks are summarized as follows:

Event Point	Content
Event Overview	Recent cyber attack activities by Bitter Elephant group
Attack Targets	China, Pakistan, etc.
Attack Methods	Email phishing, Trojan delivery, compromised websites
Attack Intent	Data theft
Attack Time	Mid 2020

2 Attack Activity Analysis
Currently observed attacker methods mainly include phishing websites and Trojan delivery.

2.1 Phishing Websites
Attackers register multiple domains and create several subdomains that mimic official domain names of many domestic organizations, then set up phishing sites to steal target email accounts and passwords. The subdomain constructions (e.g., starting with “maill.” and “maiil.”) and spoofed targets conform to Bitter Elephant’s domestic phishing attack characteristics exposed in 2019.

Victims’ entered account credentials are passed to a local PHP file on the server and finally reach the attacker:

After registering domains, attackers set up many subdomains impersonating different target sites. Some captured spoofed subdomains are shown below:

Domain	Impersonated Entity
maiil.***.tor.org.cn.owaauthlogon.com	Ministry ** of the People’s Republic of China
maiil.****.tor.org.cn.owaauthlogon.com	Ministry **** of the People’s Republic of China

2.2 Trojan Delivery
Recently, the Bitter Elephant group commonly uses execution chains such as vulnerability documents + MSI programs, CHM files + MSI programs, etc. This case is similar, using the LNK + MSI method. The attacker delivers a RAR compressed package to the target by unknown means (possibly spear-phishing emails, social platforms, etc.). Inside the package is a malicious shortcut named “Income tax Savings for 2020-2021.lnk”:

Table 2-2 LNK Sample Attributes

Attribute	Value
Virus Name	Trojan[LNK]/Downloader.LNK.Gen
Original Filename	Income tax Savings for 2020-2021.lnk
MD5	569D721E44E1A31A53AEAA0E514AD794
File Size	2.03 KB (2076 bytes)
File Format	Windows shortcut
Creation Time	2009:07:13 23:49:07+00:00
Archive Time	2020:08:31 15:08:07
Relative Path	......\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
Icon Filename	%ProgramFiles%\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoAcq.dll
VT Detection	16/59

After the shortcut is clicked and executed, it runs a Powershell command:

This Powershell loads and executes the original shortcut’s Description field, which contains multiple semicolon-separated strings of no practical effect. Finally, it silently installs a remote malicious program MsAulis.msi:

The MSI installer MsAulis.msi contains the Trojan program MsAulis.exe. Deep analysis shows that MsAulis.exe is the latest version of the known Bitter Elephant group’s proprietary .NET remote control plugin.

The domain “jg****.com” belongs to a compromised website, whose directory is open, allowing the attackers to host numerous payloads there. These payloads include the open-source Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 as well as Bitter Elephant’s known family of data theft and remote control plugins. Files named lg and lg2 are network logs; after monitoring for several days, a few suspected controlled IPs from Pakistan were observed, with no domestic victims found so far.

Table 2-3 Open Directory Payload Function List

Filename	Function
lg2	New network connection log
css.php	Used to obtain winsce
Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1	Open-source password harvesting tool Mimikatz
lg	Historical network connection log
winess	MSAService class plugin
msess	MSAService class plugin
mtess	MSAService class plugin
winesst	winsvc class plugin
winsce.msi	Packaged winsce
winsce	Remote control loader program
MsAulis.msi	Packaged rkftl
rkftl	New version MSAService class plugin
putty.php	Used to get putty.msi
putty.msi	Packaged official Putty program
MSAServices	MSAService class plugin
dlhost	audiodq class plugin
logs.php	Used to obtain MsAulis.msi, deleted

Besides the packaged shortcut, recently Bitter Elephant also uses self-extracting bait programs, which eventually implant audiodq class Trojans on target machines:

3 Leaked Weapon Analysis
3.1 Backend Architecture
In 2019, the Bitter Elephant group’s certain C2 server had its entire backend site packaged and hosted under a public path on the website. This was later crawled by an intelligence platform, resulting in source code leakage:

Analysis showed the package file was the control backend source code for Bitter Elephant’s commonly used Trojan. The overall architecture is relatively simple, built on “Nginx + PHP + MySQL” and is an older version. This backend mainly manages the controlled machines and distributes functional plugins. The approximate backend architecture is shown below:

Table 3-1 Backend File Functions

File	Function
index.html	Possibly emptied login page
index.php	Login window
login.php	Login verification
auth.php	Create new session
cfg.php	Database connection configuration
functions.php	Get total controlled machines, online, offline, dead statistics
stats.php	Display controlled machines statistics
tasks.php	Plugin task management (status, queue, delete)
update.php	Distribute plugin tasks
deletetasks.php	Delete plugin tasks
dwsl.php	Read content of serls.txt file, purpose unknown
accept.php	Communication with controlled machines, records sent data: a=hostname, b=computer name, c=OS, d=hardware ID, e=task flag. Returns "Yes file" + size of regdl plugin
clients.php	Record connection logs; display controlled machine info (SNo, IP, Computer, User, OS, Last Seen); get files in plugin directory
deletesystems.php	Delete controlled machines
error_log	Error logs
logout.php	Logout

From the source code, the database tables storing controlled machine info and tasks were organized (database instance not obtained), with probable meanings:

Table 3-2 Backend Database

Known Table	Known Fields	Presumed Meaning
user	userid, hwid, ip, computer, user, os, fseen, lseen	Controlled machine info
authPersons	name, password	Admin accounts and passwords
ddos	tasksid	Suspected DDOS tasks
downloads	id	Plugin cleanup records
tasks	exename, tid, taskid	Distributed plugin tasks
dlex	tasksid	Deleted plugin tasks

By setting up the environment and simulating a controlled machine, the source code runs as shown in Figure 3-4. Both overall and detailed interfaces and functions match those exposed in the 2019 Bitter Elephant backend leak:

Notably, the source code leak included a set of attacker database login credentials and recorded the attacker’s default timezone as Asia/Kolkata — Kolkata timezone:

3.2 Attack Plugins
Currently, over 20 plugins have been collected, covering functions such as keylogging, file theft, and remote control. Some remote control plugins are based on the open-source remote control tool DarkAgent.

3.3 Backend Camouflage
Since the beginning of this year, the login pages of the attacker’s backend have frequently changed appearances. For example, in one case, the backend initially appears to show only a single image. However, clicking the center of the image reveals hidden username and password input fields along with a login button:

Alternatively, the background is a Windows desktop image; clicking “Continue to Login” leads to the actual login page:

Or with no camouflage, the background is a landscape painting, and login proceeds after entering credentials:

4 Attack Mapping from the Threat Framework Perspective
This series of attacks involves 8 stages and 18 techniques according to the ATT&CK framework. The specific behaviors are described in the table below:

Table 4-1 Recent Bitter Elephant Group Attack Technical Behavior Description

ATT&CK Phase	Specific Behavior
Initial Access	Suspected attacker delivers Trojan via spear-phishing email or phishing link
Execution	Uses command and scripting interpreters; induces user execution
Persistence	Uses registry startup entries
Credential Access	Uses hooks to record keystrokes and OS credential dumping
Discovery	Discovers special files and directories, security software, system info, and users
Collection	Collects clipboard data
Command & Control	Uses custom encryption protocol, Base64 encoding before data exfiltration, HTTP protocol, uncommon ports, and remote control
Exfiltration	Encrypts data using custom algorithms before transmission

The related threat behaviors and technical points are mapped onto the ATT&CK framework as shown below:
