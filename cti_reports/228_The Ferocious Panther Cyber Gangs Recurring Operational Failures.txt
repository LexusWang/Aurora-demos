The Ferocious Panther Cyber Gang's Recurring Operational Failures  
Recent 360 Security Brain monitoring has detected high activity levels from the Panther ransomware, identified as another malicious campaign by the hacker group "OldPanther". The group initiated malicious operations in late May through supply chain attacks, deploying the Peviru infectious virus embedded in Chinese programming language compilation environments. This caused all user-compiled programs to become infected, with 360 Security Brain successfully intercepting and eliminating the threat. Now regrouping, OldPanther has relaunched attacks using previously deployed virus modules to disseminate the new Panther ransomware, creating renewed cybersecurity threats. Users need not panic as 360 Security Brain has become the first domestic solution to achieve decryption capabilities for Panther ransomware. Affected users should immediately install 360 Decryption Master to remove ransomware encryption and protect data assets. After disappearing temporarily, OldPanther resurfaced using familiar "oldpanther" identifiers in process chains while shifting tactics to file encryption extortion. The Panther loader fixsys.exe employs VMProtect virtualization shell protection and Process Hollowing injection into svchost.exe, encrypting files across disk partitions using directory/suffix whitelist exceptions. Utilizing RSA+AES(Rijndael) encryption via CryptoPP library, the ransomware leaves LOCKED_README.txt instructions demanding 1 Monero (~￥400) through both darknet (tjuuhyv2qk6nfvmpq5klgwjw4a54gturwqf2lrmxydioqlxwlaoveaid.onion) and clearnet (123.57.50.25:5000) payment portals, though the Monero wallet 493ZH537LvVhSkJ1TwHC3JGFWvqA98t1ZaEfUt5AKaXdFbQCoqtt5m59Qtbci6B55WEDESt6QaAwaGr1S1iUaidV1aEihnu shows no received payments. 360 Security Brain predicts continued ransomware proliferation based on Peviru infection patterns, with 360 Decryption Master already providing first domestic decryption support. As the world's largest ransomware decryption tool, 360 Decryption Master has resolved 320+ ransomware variants since November 2019, recovering 85 million files across 26,000 devices with ￥547 million losses prevented. Security recommendations include installing 360 Safeguard from weishi.360.cn, avoiding trustlist exceptions for flagged programs, using 360 Software Manager for verified installations, and utilizing lesuobingdu.360.cn for ransomware identification/decryption via 360 Decryption Master's one-click recovery.
