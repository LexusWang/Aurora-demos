Analysis of Donot APT Group's Upgraded Cyber Weapons Targeting Peripheral Regions
Overview The Donot APT group (APT-C-35), suspected to have South Asian origins, primarily targets government agencies in neighboring countries for sensitive information theft. This group possesses dual-platform attack capabilities targeting both Windows and Android systems. According to monitoring by QiAnXin RedDrip Team and QiAnXin APT Lab, Donot has recently intensified attacks using malicious macro samples and formula editor vulnerability exploitation documents against peripheral regions, while maintaining mobile attack activities. Key characteristics of current campaigns include: RTF documents embedding Excel streams containing malicious macros; constructing payload C2 addresses through character splicing from specific cell positions; introducing modular loaders separating malware into loader and encrypted data components (with loader modules showing zero detection on VirusTotal); memory-resident payload execution bypassing AV detection; and multiple test samples found on malicious template injection servers. QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center's cloud sandbox (https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox) now supports precise detection of APT samples through integrated RedDrip APT Scanner. Sample Analysis Recent captures indicate targeting of Sri Lanka and other regions, with samples including: Letter 11 Jun 20.docx (7e484c7eed8990d2f4fc4bb0028dcc49), Incident Report.xls (248323b43a58d226536202a649f88a83), and Android apps like vcallnchat-24.5.18-aligned-signed.apk (e7fdc332b5018d5b21f05324be027f01). Macro-enabled samples like Incident Report.xls use white-font strings in cells C4/C10 to hide URL components, downloading loader DLL (http://filepage.icu/f, MD5:20E20211648FC4E60A65EE2FD3A1825E) and encrypted data (http://filepage.icu/p, MD5:7CFF1A66099A48A9BB7B551BC768927A). The loader decrypts data to %Roaming%\logical\mentn.dll (MD5:24C3355E080887DC987CD8ADAF2B3475), establishing persistence via JS/LNK files. Memory-resident payloads perform VM detection (port 0x5658 check for "VMXh"), system reconnaissance, and encrypted C2 communication (using "|||" separators). Template injection samples like Letter 11 Jun 20.docx retrieve external RTF templates (http://datasecure.icu/KB4209T/10068P, MD5:033F4D56F1273A555028225D74CDE177) exploiting equation editor vulnerabilities, deploying eupol.dll to %appdata%\uppdown with scheduled task persistence. Attribution Technical overlaps with Donot's 2019 campaigns include identical AV detection paths, VS2010 debug information, VM detection methods, and C2 naming conventions. The ALPHA threat analysis platform confirms existing Donot-related tags. Expanded analysis reveals multiple test samples on template servers displaying debug messages. Conclusion Donot remains persistently active with cross-platform capabilities and continuously upgraded arsenals. Their current loader/data separation tactic achieves effective AV evasion. QiAnXin recommends enhanced security awareness training, situational awareness systems, asset management improvements, and threat intelligence integration. QiAnXin's product line including TIP, SkyEye Advanced Threat Detection System, NGSOC, and Situational Awareness Platform provides comprehensive detection for Donot's activities.
