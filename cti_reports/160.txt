National-Level APT Group Exploits SolarWinds Software in Widespread Supply Chain Attack Alert  
Background On December 13, 2020 EST, Reuters reported that foreign government-backed hackers had been monitoring internal email communications at the U.S. Treasury Department and an agency responsible for internet and telecommunications policy. Three sources revealed that the U.S. intelligence community suspects the hackers targeting the Treasury Department and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) under the Commerce Department used similar methods to infiltrate other government agencies, though specific details were not disclosed. The Washington Post stated the attack was executed through vulnerabilities in SolarWinds products by Russian APT group APT29, with U.S. officials acknowledging the incidents without providing further details. Incident Overview Shortly after the December 13 reports, FireEye published a technical analysis titled "Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor," disclosing details about the state-sponsored APT group's supply chain attack targeting SolarWinds products. Simultaneously, SolarWinds issued a security advisory confirming that versions 2019.4 to 2020.2.1 of its Orion platform software released between March and June 2020 had been compromised in a sophisticated supply chain attack, recommending immediate upgrades to version 2020.2.1 HF 1. Affected Entities SolarWinds' clientele reportedly includes Fortune 500 companies, all top U.S. telecom providers, all five branches of the U.S. military, the State Department, NSA, and the Office of the President. Based on 360 Security Brain's telemetry analysis, attackers implanted backdoors in multiple software installation/update packages officially distributed by SolarWinds. The global impact extends beyond the U.S., affecting regions including Colombia and Australia, with cross-industry organizations and enterprises experiencing varying degrees of compromise. Relevant institutions are urged to remain vigilant.
