Filesyncshell DLL Hijacking APT-C-24 Sidewinder Latest Attack Activity Briefing  
We recently captured a relatively special attack campaign initiated by APT-C-24 (Sidewinder), which adopted completely new attack methods and procedures compared to previous frameworks. Interestingly, in this campaign, due to software version discrepancies, the normal code execution logic failed to properly complete the attack activities, suggesting our old acquaintance the Sidewinder APT group might not have fully synchronized their testing environment with Chinese language configurations. The group constructed the initial execution flow around FileSyncShell.dll in this campaign, replacing the legitimate FileSyncShell.dll with malicious programs and launching it via explorer.exe through DLL sideloading to initiate the attack chain. The captured attack flow is as follows: In the attack chain, Sidewinder divided macro-enabled documents into two-stage execution, delivering the first-stage decoy document to release and execute the second-stage document. Regarding the "SaveAs" function used in VBA, Microsoft Docs mentions that when Office software saves documents as web pages (.htm, .html), it creates a folder named to store supporting files like bullets, backgrounds, images, etc. Compared to previous activities, this campaign shows significant changes in default English environment configurations, increased complexity, and employs new living-off-the-land techniques as persistence mechanisms. Unlike historical attacks that deployed RATs to devices, the "FileSyncShell64.dll/FileSyncShell.dll" demonstrates substantially improved concealment in file paths and persistence methods. Code analysis suggests Classic.dll and FileSyncShell.dll likely don't represent the final attack stage, leading us to speculate Sidewinder will ultimately deploy additional programs to devices for remote control functionality, achieving dual redundancy in remote access capabilities.
