Recent Tactics Techniques and Procedures of APT-C-53 Gamaredon  
Gamaredon Group, a Russia-aligned APT entity, has persistently conducted high-frequency cyber attacks targeting Ukraine and adjacent regions. Characterized by intensive operations and rapid campaign cycles, the group frequently generates substantial threat indicators while conspicuously exposing its Russian affiliations. This report synthesizes historical data with recent observations to analyze the evolving payloads and operational signatures observed in their latest campaigns. I. Attack Components Our previous report in late 2022 detailed Gamaredon's arsenal including VBS scripts, SFX self-extracting archives, and DLL-based file stealers. Recent monitoring reveals iterative updates to their payload delivery mechanisms, with notable changes observed since April 2023 when new file-stealing backdoors were introduced. 1. Decoy Documents Gamaredon consistently employs phishing emails delivering decoy documents, with numerous samples captured in early 2023 containing either remote template links or embedded VBA macros. Post-infection analysis shows compromised documents being repurposed as secondary propagation vectors. Content analysis indicates primary targeting of Ukrainian governmental and military personnel, with politically-themed lures demonstrating high contextual relevance. A recent specimen titled "Luhansk Region State Police Headquarters" (Ukrainian language setting visible) contained embedded remote template links (hxxp://kabinet-pfr-office[.]ru/1.dot), though historical patterns suggest successful template downloads would contain VBA macros triggering subsequent Downloader execution. 2. Dropper (1) SFX Archives The group maintains its signature SFX-based delivery chain combining VBS scripts and batch files for initial payload deployment. New variants demonstrate document infection capabilities through batch scripts modifying Word templates. Example batch file "245" invokes VBS scripts ("21738.vbs" disabling VBA warnings via registry modification, "4854.vbs" injecting malicious template links into local .doc files). (2) C++ Droppers July 2023 saw introduction of C++ droppers, likely compensating for increased AV detection of 7z SFX. Two variants emerged: Type 1 decrypts resources containing VBS downloaders with null-delimited environment variables/paths, later populated during execution. Type 2 embeds Base32-encoded payloads in file trailers (96-byte DOS header offset). An August specimen exhibited characteristic code obfuscation through redundant variables and logic, consistent with historical C# downloader patterns. 3. Downloader (1) VBS Downloaders June 2023 revealed novel VBS injection via modified PE headers of signed binaries, executed through mshta.exe. (2) C# Downloaders Updated C# variants implement enhanced obfuscation via excessive try-catch structures and externalized C2 configuration (reading from adjacent TXT files), with bloated samples reaching 80MB. (3) C++ Downloaders July 2023 introduced C++ variants incorporating legacy file-stealer algorithms (API hashing, string decryption). These implement standard HTTP POST requests with Firefox user-agents, XOR-decrypted payloads via InternetReadFile, and CreateProcess execution. 4. File Stealer Post-April 2023 EXE-based stealers show functional streamlining, removing screenshot capabilities while maintaining dual-threaded operation for document exfiltration (.doc, .xls, .rtf, .txt). Improved evasion techniques include pre-execution environment checks and network connectivity verification, achieving initial VT detection rates of 6/70 (later 19/70). II. TTP Fingerprinting 1. Obfuscation Techniques Persistent use of string fragmentation/reassembly, meaningless comments, and code stuffing across VBS/C#/C++ components. Recent VBS scripts insert personal identifiers (names, phone numbers) potentially hindering automated C2 extraction. 2. Cryptographic Methods Conventional API hashing and string encryption using arithmetic/XOR/Base combinations. Continuous code modifications through compiler parameter adjustments hinder signature creation, exemplified by varying GetApiByHash implementations across contemporaneous samples. 3. Network Characteristics HTTP-based C2 communication via WinINET with Firefox user-agents. DNS resolution precedes IP-based connectivity in both binaries and scripts. File stealers implement anomalous "Pragma: no - cache" headers with extra spacing. 4. Infrastructure Analysis Domain registry patterns (.ru TLDs via reg.ru) and IP geolocation (Moscow/St.Petersburg, TIMEWEB-hosted) reinforce Russian affiliations. All observed URLs remain inaccessible despite proxy testing, suggesting whitelisting mechanisms. Conclusion Gamaredon maintains atypical operational transparency among APT actors, deliberately exposing geographical ties while rapidly cycling through crude yet voluminous attack artifacts. Their evasion strategy relies on constant feature modification through compiler tweaks and code permutation, coupled with locally-generated polymorphic scripts that resist indicator reuse. This operational model necessitates continuous monitoring and analysis to track evolving campaigns. We will maintain persistent surveillance of this group's activities.
