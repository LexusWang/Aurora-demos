XMRig Variant Mining Malware Campaign Concealed in Hidden Corners
In recent years, leveraging Monero's superior anonymity features and mining algorithms, proliferating mining malware has been covertly operating in cryptocurrency ecosystems, creating hidden corners that infuriate victims. 360 Security Brain recently detected an XMRig Monero variant miner masquerading as a system WMI service, which has infected multiple countries globally since 2018. This malware employs sophisticated infection paths and multi-layered persistence mechanisms, making detection challenging for ordinary users. The malicious package contains WinRing0x64.sys for MSR register manipulation and ps2exe for PowerShell script conversion to executables, significantly complicating system recovery. Currently, 360 Security Guard can effectively intercept and eliminate this threat. Users are advised to update to the latest version for comprehensive protection. The malware spreads through bundled downloaders, initiating cmd processes to execute font.bat scripts that download randomized tmpxxxx.tmp.bat files from servers. These scripts subsequently deploy PowerShell to install mining components. Analysis reveals three primary attack vectors: 1) Stealth Installation - Modified open-source Monero mining scripts download GitHub-hosted payloads to %SYSTEMROOT%\SysWOW64\WMIScriptingAPI, setting system/hidden attributes and creating compiler registry entries via nssm service registration tool. 2) Covert Operation - The malicious WMIProviderHost.exe mimics system files while executing XMRig mining using srnany.exe configuration files, generating daily revenues of 0.2258 XMR ($14.71). 3) Multi-stage Arsenal - Attack tools include nssy.exe NSIS installer, WinRing0x64.sys for kernel-level hardware access, and ps2exe for executable conversion. Global infection statistics show sustained growth since 2018. 360 Security Guard provides effective countermeasures through behavioral detection and malicious process termination. Security recommendations include installing 360 Security Guard from weishi.360.cn and obtaining software exclusively from trusted sources.
