New MATA Multiplatform Malware Framework Linked to NK Lazarus APT  
The North Korea-linked Lazarus APT group has employed a novel multiplatform malware framework called MATA to target global entities. Security researchers at Kaspersky observed that the threat actors used MATA to distribute ransomware (specifically VHD ransomware) and steal customer databases. The MATA malware framework potentially targets Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, with its name derived from the "MataNet" identifier used by its authors for infrastructure. This framework implements extensive functionality enabling attackers to gain full control over compromised systems. According to Kaspersky analysts who first examined the framework, MATA operations have been active since at least April 2018, targeting software firms, e-commerce platforms, and ISPs across Poland, Germany, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, and India. The malware framework comprises multiple components including loaders, orchestrators, and plugins. Analysis revealed connections to the Lazarus group through unique filenames (c_2910.cls and k_3872.cls) previously seen in Manuscrypt variants. The MATA orchestrator uses global configuration data such as session IDs, date-based versioning, sleep intervals, and C2 server addresses. Evidence of MATA framework usage was also identified in research from Netlab 360, Malwarebytes, and Jamf. Notably, a Linux-targeting RAT named Dacls and macOS-focused trojanized 2FA apps (MinaOTP) were linked to Lazarus campaigns. The Windows version of MATA employs loaders for encrypted payload delivery and an orchestrator module (lsass.exe) capable of loading 15 plugins simultaneously, enabling file operations, DLL injection, process management, and HTTP proxy creation. The framework also targets Linux-based diskless network devices like routers and IoT equipment. Lazarus Group, associated with major cyberattacks including the 2014 Sony Pictures breach, SWIFT banking attacks, and WannaCry ransomware, continues evolving its capabilities. Kaspersky concluded that the MATA framework's cross-platform adaptability and use in both cybercrime and espionage operations warrant ongoing monitoring to protect clients.
