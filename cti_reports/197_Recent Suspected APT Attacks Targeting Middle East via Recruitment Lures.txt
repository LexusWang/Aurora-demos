Recent Suspected APT Attacks Targeting Middle East via Recruitment Lures
The volatile situation in the Middle East has persisted from ancient Mesopotamian civilizations to modern times, with ongoing conflicts rooted in religious and historical factors. The region's oil resources and geopolitical significance have drawn foreign intervention, while modern warfare increasingly prioritizes cyber intelligence gathering. During routine intelligence operations, we identified and intercepted suspected malicious document attacks targeting the Middle East. The decoy documents execute macro code upon user activation, releasing BAT and VBS files that download an AutoIT downloader, ultimately deploying a simple RAT to capture screen shots, machine documents, and user information. The captured documents employ recruitment themes commonly used in Middle Eastern attacks, consistent with APT34's recent campaigns using job-seeking keywords. A previously analyzed APT34-associated document similarly contained chip/PC product-related job postings for sales managers, HR personnel, and technical support roles as social engineering lures. The current document titled "VIP-jobs" displays legitimate-looking online recruitment content while secretly executing macros that deploy BAT files to the Windows startup directory. The BAT file contains obfuscated VBS code that downloads an AutoIT downloader from a disguised domain. The 64-bit AutoIT executable stores encrypted scripts in its resource section, requiring specialized decryption methods including AutoItSC.bin conversion and exe2aut decompilation to reveal the RAT-downloading script. The .NET-based RAT demonstrates comprehensive functionality despite simple development, including system information collection, network communication, and remote control commands (screenshot, file transfer, process monitoring). All strings undergo Base64 encryption to evade static detection, with assemblies disguised as IE cache components and random delays implemented for sandbox evasion. APT attacks frequently leverage current events and social engineering tactics, as exemplified by this recruitment-themed campaign. Organizations should enhance staff training, avoid opening suspicious documents/archives, and maintain updated security solutions to mitigate such threats.
