Overview
Recently, the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center exposed a trojan tool named "NOPEN" (detailed in the second article released today on the Antian public account titled "NOPEN Remote Control Trojan Analysis Report"). This tool is a powerful comprehensive trojan used by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and is one of the NSA's main cyber weapons for offensive attacks and espionage. Related leaked documents show that this trojan has already controlled computer systems in multiple countries worldwide.

Since the Stuxnet incident in 2010, Antian has continuously analyzed and tracked global APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack activities. Among them, the attacks and attack tools launched by the U.S. side represent the pinnacle of APT capabilities and are named by Antian as A2PT (Advanced Advanced Persistent Threat). In a series of reports published by Antian exposing U.S. attack tools and activities, they revealed the persistence mechanism of the "Equation Group" implanting into hard disk firmware (2015), trojan encrypted communication protocols (2015), and were the first to expose samples on the U.S. Solaris platform (2016), as well as complete the analysis of modular trojan components (2017). The "NOPEN" trojan is one member of the U.S. standardized cyber attack tools. In the report publicly released by Antian on June 1, 2019, they traced and reviewed U.S. attacks on the Middle East EastNets institution [1], mentioning this tool.

To provide global computer users with a more comprehensive understanding of A2PT attack tools and characteristics for effective security protection, this report compiles already published analysis report highlights along with some unpublished findings.

NSA Cyber Attack Tools and Platforms
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has developed a systematic cyber attack platform and a standardized arsenal of attack tools. The NSA's TAO (Tailored Access Operations) is the main user of these attack tools. The office is divided into five departments: ANT (Advanced Network Technology), DNT (Data Network Technologies), ATO (Access Technologies Operations), MIT (Mission Infrastructure Technologies), and TNT (Telecommunications Network Technologies). Currently, the attack tools of the ANT and DNT departments have been frequently exposed, with typical representatives including 48 ANT toolkits and DNT's Fuzzbunch exploit platform and DanderSpritz remote control attack platform leaked by the Shadow Brokers.

2.1 ANT Attack Tool Family
The ANT attack tool family is a set of attack tools successively deployed by the U.S. around 2008, covering mainstream desktop hosts, servers, network devices, network security devices, mobile communication devices, etc. The equipment forms include malicious code payloads, computer peripherals, signal communication devices, etc. These tools can be combined to achieve complex attack goals. According to Snowden-leaked materials, the U.S. implanted backdoors into global mainstream network devices via ANT, with a total of 48 types of attack tools surfaced, involving both software and hardware. Among them, software tools are mainly used to implant persistent backdoors into various IT device systems, primarily aimed at stealing information; hardware tools mainly implant attack capabilities into IT hardware or exist as independent hardware devices for signal theft, monitoring, interception, and establishing communication channels. The table below lists the 48 exposed network attack tools.

2.2 DNT Attack Tools
On April 14, 2017, the Shadow Brokers organization exposed the NSA’s Fuzzbunch exploit platform and DanderSpritz remote control platform, claiming these attack tools were related to the Equation Group. According to relevant analysis and materials, these attack tools were developed by the U.S. several years ago, involving a large number of system-level 0-day exploit tools and advanced backdoor programs, revealing the U.S.'s vulnerability stockpiling capabilities and attack technology level.

2.2.1 Fuzzbunch Exploit Platform

Fuzzbunch is a penetration and attack platform responsible for exploiting vulnerabilities to implant payloads (generated by DanderSpritz) onto target hosts. During implantation, it can execute directly in memory without creating physical files.

After the leak of this attack platform, the “EternalBlue” vulnerability was exploited by the WannaCry worm to spread, causing serious damage to global networks. The “EternalBlue” vulnerability was only one of many in this vulnerability library, with other vulnerabilities possessing extremely strong lateral movement exploitation capabilities. In May 2017, Antian organized these vulnerabilities into the following diagram:

2.2.2 DanderSpritz Remote Control Platform

DanderSpritz is a remote control platform whose generated payload, once implanted into a remote host, can achieve full control over the target machine. It employs covert activation communication methods, uses strict encryption during communication, and can perform arbitrary tasks (such as data theft, deployment of more advanced attack payloads, etc.) through a series of extended plugins.

With the DanderSpritz platform, attackers can exert comprehensive control over victim hosts. Specifically, operations are completed by combining hundreds of plugins to achieve corresponding functions. These plugins embody the following architectural style—not by writing a single highly complex Trojan, but by breaking down functions into highly independent small modules. This granularity of decomposition is nearly "atomic" in nature; even simple operations like retrieving system information are split into separate small modules for gathering environment variables, language packs, network status, etc. This ensures that system tasks can be carried out fully on demand, maximizing operational caution and stealth.

Most of the files exposed by the "Shadow Brokers" are attack plugins for the DanderSpritz platform. From the released file list, the attack tools and plugins are rich and standardized, including remote control, exploit, backdoor, plugins, and more. For example, the DanderSpritz_All_Find.txt file contains more than 7,000 lines, with hundreds of plugins.

NSA Network Attack Equipment Development Framework

The US advantage in network attack equipment derives from its attempt to cover all major IT operational targets and years of sustained investment.

In 2011, Antiy proposed the hypothesis that Stuxnet and Duqu viruses might share the same origin, based on follow-up analysis of Stuxnet [2][3]. By comparing key code structures, key usage methods, and code logic between Duqu and Stuxnet worm, many identical or similar code fragments were discovered, confirming the hypothesis [5]. Antiy concluded at the time that “through the comparison of key code structures, key usage methods, and code logic between Duqu virus and Stuxnet worm, we found many identical or similar code fragments, indicating a code reuse relationship or development based on the same code framework.” However, it did not determine whether it was reuse or framework-based development. Combining subsequent analyses from other institutions, the conclusion is that related A2PT attack organizations at least maintained two malicious code frameworks: Tilded and Flamer. Stuxnet and Duqu, Flame, Gauss were developed based on Tilded and Flamer frameworks respectively. On June 11, 2012, Kaspersky reported that an early 2009 version (0.5) of the Stuxnet module ("Resource 207") was actually a Flame plugin. This finding linked the two completely different frameworks, Flamer and Tilded. Malicious codes based on these two frameworks possess unique techniques for infecting target systems and executing main tasks, and are used to develop different cyber attack tools. Kaspersky concluded that the teams behind the two frameworks once shared at least one module's source code, indicating at least one collaboration, and that they belonged to two parallel projects within the same organization [12]. Further clues connect Fanny and Flowershop to the above incidents. Their relationships are shown in Figure 3-1.

Characteristics of US Network Attack Operations

Based on Antiy’s analysis of US-related weapons and attack operations, the following characteristics summarize US network attack operations:

Comprehensive pre-attack reconnaissance and information gathering. For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the US conducted over four years of preparation, fully infiltrating Iran’s foundational industrial organizations before attacking Iranian nuclear facilities, including equipment manufacturers, suppliers, software developers, etc., thoroughly studying and simulating Iran's nuclear industrial system before the final attack.

Abundant zero-day exploit reserves and saturation multi-vulnerability combination use. For example, in the Stuxnet attack, the US used no fewer than five zero-day vulnerabilities; in attacks on Middle Eastern SWIFT service providers, at least seven zero-day vulnerabilities were used. This indicates the US possesses extremely rich zero-day exploit reserves and employs a “Van Flett ammunition” style approach with saturation multi-vulnerability exploitation in strategic operations.

Exceptional boundary breach capabilities. The US has abundant exploits for network devices like firewalls, routers, switches, VPNs, and employs complete toolsets to penetrate and control network boundaries and devices, conduct traffic forwarding, and use these as relay stations for sustained attacks on internal networks. For example, in the attack on Middle Eastern largest SWIFT service provider EastNets, the US first penetrated external VPN firewalls and internal enterprise firewalls, then installed traffic-forwarding trojans on firewalls.

Combination of human, electromagnetic, and cyber operations. The US views cyberspace only as one channel for data theft, combining human and electromagnetic methods to achieve optimal attack results. For instance, the ANT equipment “Water Moccasin I” is an electromagnetic-cyber hybrid device combining USB injection and wireless data exfiltration with a maximum communication range up to 8 miles.

Exceptional ability to bypass physical isolation. The US uses logistics chain hijacking, insider cooperation, peripherals, and auxiliary signal devices to establish beachheads and second electromagnetic channels, overcoming air-gapped networks. For example, in Stuxnet, Dutch intelligence personnel entered the site and connected USB devices carrying Stuxnet into isolated internal networks to launch attacks.

Ultra-large scale modular malicious code engineering. Payload frameworks and loaders are highly complex to counter analysis and detection. Initial payload delivery performs limited data collection and persistence, only deploying advanced payloads remotely when conditions meet. These features can be observed in the structure of Trojan platforms like DanderSpritz and in retrospectives of attacks on targets like EastNets.

Strict local and network encryption. Payload configuration data, resources, functions are encrypted to counter antivirus and sandbox detection; network communications use asymmetric encryption. Payloads may await network requests for activation to evade network-side detection. From Stuxnet to later samples, encryption use is widespread.

Extensive use of fileless technology. Payloads are loaded and executed directly in memory or create hidden disk storage. Since at least 2008, the US has widely employed fileless memory trojans. Stuxnet loaders exhibit hash changes on each landing to invalidate file-based threat intelligence like MD5.

Deeply covert persistence capabilities, including firmware persistence and persistence in firewalls, mail gateways. For example, DanderSpritz includes components that write to hard disk firmware, enabling reactivation after OS reinstallation on targeted hosts.

Payloads cover all operating system platforms. Samples found in US attacks include Windows, Linux, Solaris, Android, OSX, iOS, etc., as detailed in Antiy’s historical report “From Equation to Equation Group.”

Summary

Network security defense must face threats and adversaries squarely, fully recognizing the severe risks and challenges faced. It must deeply implement the overall national security concept to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests. Analyzing the organization, support systems, attack equipment, operational methods, operational systems, and action characteristics of ultra-high capability cyber threat actors is a crucial basis for targeted defense and constructing objective enemy scenarios. Building network security defenses on correct enemy assumptions is essential to creating dynamic, comprehensive, and effective cybersecurity capabilities.

Appendix: Antiy’s Continuous Analysis of US Attack Groups and Incidents

Antiy has continuously tracked and analyzed US attack groups and related events, releasing dozens of analytical reports since 2010 [4].

In 2010, Antiy released the “Comprehensive Report on Stuxnet Worm Attacking Industrial Control Systems” [6], analyzing the attack process, propagation, intent, file relationships, multiple zero-day vulnerabilities exploited, summarizing characteristics, and providing solutions and reflections. This was among the earliest comprehensive reverse-engineered reports on Stuxnet in China, serving as an important public reference for understanding Stuxnet’s truth and details. In October of the same year, a supplementary report noted that Stuxnet’s USB spread was controlled by seven sets of configuration data including timestamps and conditions; it also analyzed propagation and updates via RPC, shared services, remote access to WinCC databases, and DLL hijacking to attack Siemens PLCs, confirming the targeted nature of Stuxnet’s injected PLC code.

In September 2011, Antiy released “Analysis Report on the Homology of Duqu and Stuxnet” [6], analyzing Duqu virus modules, compiler architecture, key functions, finding similarities to Stuxnet’s corresponding structures and functions. By analyzing Duqu’s decryption keys, anti-tracking, and bugs, the virus author’s coding psychological traits resembled Stuxnet’s logic. Based on identical logical errors in both samples, coding psychology judged them homologous, published in the report and in “Programmer” magazine.

In January 2012, Antiy Microelectronics and Embedded Security R&D Center published “What Happened After WinCC” [6], hypothesizing Stuxnet’s attack scenario: assuming centrifuge speed is controlled by a PID algorithm, Stuxnet attacks WinCC and alters PID parameters in the database, causing centrifuge speed changes or control failures, potentially reducing separation power and uranium enrichment efficiency.

In July 2012, Antiy released nearly 100 pages of “Flame Worm Sample Analysis Report” [7], covering less than 5% of Flame’s modules and triggering reflection on modular pile-up style analysis by Antiy CERT.

From 2015 to 2017, Antiy released four bilingual reports on the Equation Group, including “Hard Disk Firmware Trojan—Exploring Equation’s Attack Components” [8], “Encryption Techniques in Some Equation Components” [9], “From Equation to Equation Group—Analysis of Equation’s Advanced Malicious Code’s Cross-Platform Capabilities” [10], and “Analysis of Equation Group’s EQUATIONDRUG Platform” [11]. These reports detail hard disk firmware reprogramming mechanisms, attack module nls_933w.dll analysis, verifying ultra-high capability threat actors’ persistence in all persistent scenarios, local registry and remote communication data algorithms (using modified RC symmetric algorithms), complete decryption algorithms and key structures, decrypting nearly all of the group’s cross-platform attack capabilities, exclusive global Linux and Solaris samples, and revealing the Equation Group’s modular host operational structure.

In 2019, Antiy first introduced the Equation Group’s attack on Middle Eastern financial services EastNets, combining historical analysis with Shadow Brokers leak data for new insights. That year, Antiy released the “Equation Group Attack on EastNets SWIFT Service Provider Incident Retrospective Report” [12], precisely restoring the affected IT assets panorama and topology, fully reproducing the kill chain, detailing weapons and procedures, and visualizing the attack.

On September 30, 2019, Antiy published a long report “Nine-Year Retrospective and Reflection on the Stuxnet Incident” [13], comparing Stuxnet versions and mechanisms, analyzing advanced malicious code engineering frameworks, connections between Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame, and later Equation Group malware. It outlined Stuxnet’s timeline, structure, logic, reasons for multiple samples, reflected on challenges in current network security detection engines and threat intelligence facing APTs, and contemplated establishing more reliable baseline identification and response capabilities, better TTP support, more trustworthy organizational intelligence, and improved knowledge engineering to counter advanced A2PT cyber threats.
