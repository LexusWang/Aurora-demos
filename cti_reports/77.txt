Analysis Report on DarkSide's Targeted Ransomware Attacks Against US Critical Infrastructure
DarkSide is an emerging Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) criminal group, potentially organized by former branches of other ransomware operations. According to their previously published attack policy, the group exclusively targets organizations outside healthcare, government, education, non-profit, and funeral industries. As detailed in 360's "January 2021 Ransomware Trend Analysis," this ransomware family first emerged in August 2020, with 81 enterprises publicly confirmed as victims to date. On April 20, 2021, DarkSide announced via dark web that they had compromised multiple NASDAQ-listed companies and encrypted core data, threatening to leak stolen information for short-selling profits if ransoms remained unpaid. The May 7, 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline, America's largest fuel pipeline operator, forced shutdown of critical fuel supply networks serving eastern states. Technical analysis reveals DarkSide's unique operational pattern: prior to ransomware deployment, they conduct extensive data exfiltration using a distributed storage system hosted in Iran. The group employs penetration testing tools for vulnerability scanning, targets Windows domain controllers for network dominance, and develops both Windows and Linux variants. Their customized ransom notes specifically threaten leakage of accounting, operational, sales, customer support, and marketing data. The ransomware performs administrator checks, deletes volume shadow copies via PowerShell (Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}), employs Salsa20 encryption with RSA-1024 wrapped keys, and drops unique file extensions like ".82a71c82". C2 communications observed include hxxp://securebestapp20.com/mhzPjMHjEl. Forensic evidence shows language-based targeting exclusion (no encryption on Russian-language systems) and forum recruitment patterns suggesting strong Russian-speaking membership. As predicted in 360's "2020 Global APT Research Report," targeted ransomware attacks blending destructive/espionage objectives have significantly increased, with over 20 major incidents affecting corporations like Intel, Foxconn, Embraer, and Honda in 2020 alone. Security recommendations include immediate network isolation upon detection, comprehensive credential rotation, access control implementation for shared resources, and regular vulnerability patching.
