Mysterious AcidBox Malware Leverages Turla Exploits to Target Russian Organizations  
Palo Alto Networks researchers have analyzed a new malware called AcidBox used in targeted attacks that exploits vulnerabilities previously associated with the Russia-linked Turla APT group. Believed to act on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and also known as Waterbug, Venomous Bear, and KRYPTON operations, Turla was the first threat actor known to abuse third-party device drivers to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE), a security feature introduced in Windows Vista to prevent loading unsigned drivers. Turla's exploit commonly referred to as CVE-2008-3431 leverages a signed VirtualBox driver (VBoxDrv.sys v1.6.2) to deactivate DSE and load unsigned payload drivers, effectively exploiting two vulnerabilities though only one was addressed. A second version of the exploit targeted an unknown vulnerability exclusively. Palo Alto Networks now reveals an unknown threat actor unaffiliated with Turla is exploiting the same unpatched security vulnerability to target newer versions of VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys drivers. The attackers targeted at least two different Russian organizations in 2017 by exploiting driver version 2.2.0, possibly because this iteration wasn't vulnerable. The attackers deployed a previously unknown malware family researchers named AcidBox. Palo Alto Networks stated: "Since no other victims have been identified, we consider this to be a very rare malware used exclusively for targeted attacks." AcidBox represents a sophisticated malware component within a larger toolset potentially linked to advanced threat actors, possibly still in use if the attackers remain active. "However, we expect it would be somewhat rewritten. Based on the information we have, we believe this unknown threat actor has no relation to Turla beyond the exploit used," said Palo Alto Networks, which provided detailed analysis of the malware. Researchers collaborated with other security firms to identify three user-mode samples of the malware (64-bit DLLs loading main workers from Windows Registry) and one kernel-mode payload driver (embedded within main worker samples). All samples bore compilation timestamps from May 9, 2017, and were likely used in campaigns during the same year. No new samples were found, and the threat actor's current activity status remains unclear. AcidBox appends sensitive data as overlays in icon resources, abuses SSP interface for persistence and injection, stores payloads in Windows Registry, and shows no significant overlap with known malware except potential code similarities to Remsec. While unable to identify AcidBox's parent toolkit, Palo Alto Networks shared two YARA rules for detection/threat hunting and a Python script to help victims extract sensitive data appended to icon resources.
