GoldDigger Concealed in Investment Pitch Decks Analysis Report on APT-C-26 Lazarus Campaign  
In the second half of 2021, 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute discovered multiple attack campaigns from APT-C-26 (Lazarus). Since July of that year, we captured multiple lure documents titled "Venture Labo Investment Pitch Deck(Protected).docx" containing introductions about Venture Labo Investment Co., Ltd., a Tokyo-based venture capital firm. The document utilizes remote template injection (CVE-2017-0199) to load remote templates from external links upon opening. Users are then tricked into enabling macros, allowing data retrieval from remote addresses for backdoor operations through process injection into legitimate processes. This campaign aimed to steal cryptocurrency, showing overlaps in payloads, attack chains, and IOCs with BlueNoroff (a Lazarus subgroup), indicating it belongs to BlueNoroff's operations. The attackers employed investment-related decoy documents where malicious macros load item1.xml from the customXml directory, decrypt data, and inject into legitimate processes based on system architecture. These processes subsequently download payloads and communicate with C&C servers. Domain overlaps including venturelabo[.]co and azureword[.]com further confirm attribution to the same group. The decoy document displays post-template loading instructions prompting users to "Enable Content" for editing under "Information Protection Controls".
