Preface
For more than half a century, the relationship between India and Pakistan has been marked by periods of tension and easing. The conflicts between the two countries stem from multiple causes including territorial disputes, religion, and geopolitical competition. Their relations have long been trapped in a cycle of "confrontation — brief easing — renewed confrontation," with armed clashes in the Kashmir region almost never ceasing, making it a powder keg in South Asia.
Timeline of Historical Conflicts between India and Pakistan
1947.8
India and Pakistan officially partitioned.
1947.10
India and Pakistan engaged in armed conflict over the Kashmir issue, triggering the "First Indo-Pak War."
1960...
India and Pakistan signed the "Indus Waters Treaty," resolving the sharing of waters of the Indus River flowing through both countries.
1965-1966
The "Second Indo-Pak War" broke out.
1971...
East Pakistan launched an independence movement to separate from Pakistan, triggering the "Third Indo-Pak War," resulting in the independence of East Pakistan as Bangladesh.

2003.11
India and Pakistan achieved a ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

On April 22, 2025, a terrorist attack targeting tourists occurred in Indian-controlled Kashmir. On the night of April 23, India announced the suspension of multiple retaliatory measures including water sharing. On April 24, Pakistan announced a series of countermeasures against India. Small-scale clashes broke out along the Kashmir Line of Control between the Indian and Pakistani militaries.

On May 7, Indian armed forces launched an operation code-named "Cinnabar" targeting facilities in Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, escalating the Indo-Pak conflict again.

On May 10, 2025, India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire agreement.

APT Attacks Active in South Asian Cyberspace

Prior to the outbreak of the #IndoPakConflict, 360 Advanced Threat Research team, through continuous global cyberspace monitoring, captured active attacks by APT groups operating in South Asia. The open and covert cyber hostilities in South Asia reflect the tense and hostile developments between India and Pakistan.

Fields and Intentions of APT Group Attacks

During the ongoing Indo-Pak tensions, the major active APT groups in South Asian cyberspace include APT-C-24 (#Rattlesnake), APT-C-35 (#Brainworm), APT-C-08 (#Climbing Nightshade), and APT-C-09 (#Mahac草). Indian-affiliated cyberattack groups mainly target critical sectors such as government diplomacy, defense and military, and transportation in neighboring geopolitical countries. The attack targets are mainly concentrated in Pakistan but also affect Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and other South Asian and neighboring countries and regions.

APT Group Attack Tactics and Techniques Analysis
1. APT-C-24 (Rattlesnake)
1.1 Attack Tactics Summary
Through analysis of Rattlesnake's attacks targeting Pakistani-related entities during the ongoing India-Pakistan confrontation, this group primarily employs two attack flows:

Flow One: Delivers documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882 vulnerabilities as initial access payloads. Upon triggering the vulnerability, a remote-executed JavaScript script loads subsequent attack components.

Rattlesnake Recent Attack Flow One

Flow Two: Delivers compressed packages containing malicious .lnk files as initial payloads. Once executed, the .lnk file uses mshta to remotely load an .hta script, which executes embedded JavaScript and loads further attack components in memory.

Rattlesnake Recent Attack Flow Two

1.2 Sample Analysis
1.2.1 Vulnerability Documents
360 recently captured phishing emails using documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882 vulnerabilities linked to Rattlesnake:


Rattlesnake Phishing Email

Malicious document content in the phishing email

Opening this malicious document remotely loads follow-up RTF documents. Due to attacker server configuration, non-targeted regions receive empty RTF documents with only headers. Targeted users trigger the exploit, executing JavaScript scripts.

1.2.4 JavaScript Script
The JavaScript is typically generated by the NotNetToJScript project, primarily functioning to drop decoy documents and load .NET assemblies. It includes logic to check the physical memory size of the host to detect virtual machine environments as an anti-analysis measure.
Physical memory size check logic in JavaScript

1.2.5 Backdoor Component app.dll
This component acts as a downloader, fetching subsequent attack modules from remote servers. The data is XOR-decrypted, with the first 32 bytes serving as the key.
Backdoor component: app.dll

1.2.6 Backdoor Component sxshared.dll
This is a JavaScript loader that connects to the remote server to obtain subsequent JavaScript scripts and executes them in memory.
Backdoor component: sxshared.dll

1.2.7 Backdoor Component Dwrite.dll
A loader component, usually obfuscated, responsible for loading and executing subsequent components from designated files.
Backdoor component: Dwrite.dll

1.2.8 Backdoor Component Moduleinstaller.dll
A persistence component that creates scheduled tasks and startup entries to remain resident. It collects system information and sends it back, while also retaining the ability to deploy further components.

2. APT-C-08 (Climbing Nightshade)
2.1 Attack Tactics Summary
In recent attacks, APT-C-08 uses CHM and searchconnector-ms files as initial payloads to conduct phishing attacks targeting Pakistani-related entities. Decoy document themes center on business cooperation and military exercises. When victims open samples, a scheduled task is created to periodically send device and user information to the C2, which replies with PowerShell or CMD commands to download and execute follow-up backdoors and data-stealing modules.

2.2 Sample Analysis
2.2.1 Delivered Payloads
In phishing emails targeting Pakistan, the searchconnector-ms files are Windows Search Connector configuration files. The simpleLocation tag records the remote address. When the user opens the sample, it maps remote files locally via the WebDAV protocol.
Mapped file is a shortcut disguised as a PDF; the shortcut commands create a periodic scheduled task to download and execute follow-up modules.
Scheduled task command executes periodically, sending device and username info back to C2. Powershell or CMD commands are downloaded and stored with  or other extensions in user paths.


2.2.2 Backdoor Component uvcresc.exe
MD5: 45a0b47a3e6a6f331d73b7968433e7f1
File Name: uvcresc.exe
File Size: 138.00 KB (141312 bytes)
File Type: Win32 EXE

Main function: keylogger. Uses SetWindowsHookExW to set a keyboard message callback to capture keystrokes. It then creates a thread to save logged keys locally.
Keyboard hook captures normal and combination key presses. When matching criteria are met, the sample attempts to get the active window name and checks Shift and Control key status.
Detects Ctrl+V paste operation and captures clipboard data.
Data processing thread parses keystrokes, with 888888 indicating window name parsing and 999999 for clipboard data parsing, then writes parsed data to files.
