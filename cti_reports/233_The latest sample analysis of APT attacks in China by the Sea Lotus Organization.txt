Overview
Antiy CERT (Security Research and Emergency Response Center) has captured multiple samples of malicious macro document attacks targeting Chinese users since December 2018. These malicious documents disguise antivirus scan results on a blurred text background to lure victims into enabling malicious macros, which inject shellcode into the Word process itself and eventually decrypt and execute a backdoor in memory. Through in-depth analysis of this backdoor, we found the sample originates from the Hailianhua [1] group.
Antiy released an analysis report on this group on May 27, 2015 [1], which sparked ongoing industry attention. Given that commercial attack platform Cobalt Strike was used in attacks captured at that time, Antiy named the group APT-TOCS (APT group leveraging CS platform). However, since using CS was only one characteristic and lacked geographical naming features, we later adopted the naming from peer company 360 — “Hailianhua.” The newly discovered samples are very similar to the Hailianhua-specific backdoor exposed by ESET in December 2018 [2]. By correlating the C2 of these backdoor samples, we found more samples spreading this backdoor via malicious self-extracting programs. Some samples target China, while more target multiple countries including Cambodia. Some self-extracting samples’ backdoors connect their C2 directly to known Hailianhua group network infrastructure. Due to strong correlation between dedicated backdoors and network infrastructure, we have reason to believe these samples and associated attacks are conducted by the Hailianhua APT group.
Sample Analysis
2.1 Sample Labels
The relevant attack payloads are all Word documents, but no vulnerabilities were exploited. Instead, malicious macro code was embedded inside, triggering subsequent malicious behavior to implant backdoors on target machines. This has been a popular method recently. To trick victims into enabling macros, attackers use deceptive content in the document body to lure users to click “Enable Content,” triggering malicious macro execution. We list intelligence tags for two samples from this batch:

2.2 Technical Analysis
The related document samples employ social engineering techniques, disguising themselves as 360 antivirus scan results to lure victims into enabling the attached malicious macros. The main content is shown in Figures 2-1 and 2-2.

The malicious samples contain obfuscated VB scripts. After deobfuscation, the script’s functions are:

1. Copy the current file to the %temp% folder.

2. Obtain and decrypt the second script segment, attempting to write to the registry ("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\AccessVBOM"). When this registry value is 1, access and modification of the document’s VB modules are allowed, as shown below:

3. Open the copied document in %temp%, remove existing VB modules, and write a new module (Figure 2-4):

4. Open the copied document and invoke the "x_N0th1ngH3r3" function in the VB module as shown below. Afterwards, the malicious document displays a fake message, as Figures 2-5 and 2-6 show:

The second script segment is quite similar to the first. After decrypting the third script segment, it sets the registry to gain the ability to modify its own VB resources, then embeds the third script into the document itself:
The third script decrypts shellcode and injects it into the winword.exe process. The script entry function is also named "x_N0th1ngH3r3." This function detects whether the process is 64-bit or 32-bit and uses appropriate injection methods:

The injected code size is 908 KB (929,792 bytes). Deep analysis revealed this injected code leads to executing the final backdoor program, which ESET exposed in December 2018 as developed and used by the Hailianhua group [2].

The backdoor’s original name is "{A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll," shown below:

The backdoor first initializes by loading the resource section RCData into memory, decrypting configuration data and library files:

The decrypted data contents are:

The contents in Figure 2-12, from top to bottom, represent:

1) Registry locations:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\App\AppX70162486c7554f7f80f481985d67586d\Application
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\App\AppX70162486c7554f7f80f481985d67586d\DefaultIcon
These registry keys store the unique UUID returned by the backdoor’s C2 to the victim host, used as the session ID. For example, during actual debugging: 32034d33-aecc-47d4-9dcd-f0e56063087f.
2) httpprov library file, used to support HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS communications with the C2, statically linked with libcurl.
After initialization, the backdoor begins POST communications with available C2s in the list using HTTP. The HTTP User Agent is: 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0)'.
3) The backdoor generates a fingerprint of the victim host. Supported functions include process operations, registry operations, retrieving hard disk information, local file operations, deploying and executing programs, memory injection, etc. There are no major changes compared to the ESET-exposed version [2]. As shown, case 0x1 moves files, case 0x3 retrieves hard disk info, and cases 0, 2, 4, 5 also include: 0xe file traversal, 0xf file deletion, 0x12 folder creation, 0x13 folder deletion.
The captured Hailianhua samples show some technical improvements compared to previous versions, using macro code for shellcode injection. The entire payload deployment is fileless, indicating the Hailianhua group is actively updating their attack techniques to become more covert, aiming for longer-term persistence on victim machines.

3. Correlation Analysis
When analyzing the unique C2-resolved IP of the backdoor: 45.122.., we noticed this IP was used as a C2 connection by a malicious self-extracting program “AcroRd32.exe” disguised as the Adobe Reader main program:
The RAR self-extractor was uploaded under the filename “Li Jianxiang (Personal Resume).exe,” with a last modification time close to Malicious Document 1. The icon is disguised as Adobe Reader. When run, it registers and runs malicious controls via the “regsvr32” command, then opens a password-encrypted Chinese PDF document. Since the password is currently unavailable, the content is unknown but appears non-malicious.
Through sample correlation, we found earlier self-extracting samples using the same method to attack Cambodia and other countries:

All currently discovered related self-extracting samples disguise their icons as Adobe Reader, Office, images, etc. Some sample filenames are also disguised as: “AcroRd32.exe,” “Excel.exe,” “WinWord.exe,” and others:

The included images and Word documents are normal files, serving to distract victims after the malicious payload runs successfully.
The malicious OCX controls embedded in all self-extracting samples decrypt and invoke the final backdoor in memory. We performed code comparison between all extracted backdoor samples and the backdoor released by the malicious documents in Section 2, finding them highly consistent, basically confirming the same origin. Some of these backdoors connect to known network infrastructure of the Hailianhua group: 154.16.***.***, an IP repeatedly exposed by multiple security vendors [3], maintained and used long-term by the Hailianhua group.

4. Summary
From the above analysis, the Hailianhua group remains active recently. They launch attacks targeting users in China and multiple Southeast Asian countries, delivering malicious macro documents and self-extracting programs to ultimately spread their dedicated backdoor, achieving long-term control and data theft from targets. Based on the backdoor tools and network infrastructure (with some backdoors connecting directly to known Hailianhua infrastructure), all evidence points to these samples originating from the Hailianhua APT group.
As we noted previously in the "2018 Cyber Threat Annual Report (Pre-release)," the effect of “forcing APT groups to converge their behaviors through exposure analysis” has significantly diminished. The continued use of exposed C2 infrastructure by these attackers is proof of this. On one hand, this dispels any illusion that simple deterrence tactics will cause the enemy to retreat; on the other hand, it increases the attack surface visibility of advanced generalized threat actors, providing some opportunity and conditions for investigation, analysis, and further hunting.
Antian’s product ecosystem achieves full-format recognition and deep parsing, compound document decomposition, and macro extraction through its long-term independently developed AVL SDK "next-generation antivirus engine"; the Zhijia endpoint defense system implements detection and blocking at multiple defense points on the host side; the Tanhai threat detection system detects attack behaviors and captures payloads at the traffic side. Unknown files discovered at each stage can be linked to the Zhuying sandbox for analysis, outputting threat intelligence rules. When deployed in well-managed network environments, this can effectively respond to attacks of similar level. Current Antian product customers can subscribe to the "Advanced Threat Traceback Package" for further risk tracing and investigation. However, to counter higher-level attacks, a tactical situational awareness platform running in real combat is further needed to achieve global command, situational control, and coordinated response.
