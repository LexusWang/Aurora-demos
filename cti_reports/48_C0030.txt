In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles engaged in network reconnaissance against targets of interest.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used a publicly available PowerShell-based tool, WMImplant.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles developed, prior to the attack, malware capabilities that would require access to specific and specialized hardware and software.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used cryptcat binaries to encrypt their traffic.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles captured credentials as they were being changed by redirecting text-based login codes to websites they controlled.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles renamed files to look like legitimate files, such as Windows update files or Schneider Electric application files.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles modified files based on the open-source project cryptcat in an apparent attempt to decrease anti-virus detection rates.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used tools such as Mimikatz and other open-source software.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used Mimikatz.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles installed scheduled tasks defined in XML files.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles changed phone numbers tied to certain specific accounts in a designated contact list. They then used the changed phone numbers to redirect network traffic to websites controlled by them, thereby allowing them to capture and use any login codes sent to the devices via text message.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles’ tool took one option from the command line, which was a single IP address of the target Triconex device.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles would programmatically return the controller to a normal running state if the Triton malware failed. If the controller could not recover in a defined time window, TEMP.Veles programmatically overwrote their malicious program with invalid data.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles made attempts on multiple victim machines to transfer and execute the WMImplant tool.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles tripped a controller into a failed safe state, which caused an automatic shutdown of the plant, this resulted in a pause of plant operations for more than a week. Thereby impacting industrial processes and halting productivity.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles downloaded multiple rounds of control logic to the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers through a program append operation.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles utilized remote desktop protocol (RDP) jump boxes, poorly configured OT firewalls [1], along with other traditional malware backdoors, to move into the ICS environment.[2]In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used a publicly available PowerShell-based tool, WMImplant.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles leveraged Triton to send unauthorized command messages to the Triconex safety controllers.In the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack, TEMP.Veles used valid credentials when laterally moving through RDP jump boxes into the ICS environment.
