Exclusive Four-Point Analysis Confirms the Underestimated Chaos Legion New APT Group WellMess Magic Rat  
On July 16, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Canadian Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and US National Security Agency (NSA) jointly reported that APT29 utilized WellMess tools to target COVID-19 research and vaccine development institutions in the US, UK, and Canada. Notably, the "WellMess" highlighted in the report represents a new APT group. As early as 2019, 360 Security Brain had detected and documented a series of WellMess APT activities, designating it as "Magic Rat" with independent numbering APT-C-42. Crucially, 360 Security Brain revealed that since December 2017, WellMess has conducted targeted attacks through network infiltration and supply chain compromise against a domestic network infrastructure service provider. 360 Security Brain has now exposed the previously undisclosed WellMess APT group, codenamed "Magic Rat" (APT-C-42). From December 2017 to December 2019, WellMess persistently attacked servers of specific organizations and network infrastructure service providers. While Japan's JPCERT/CC reported related activities in 2018, they merely classified WellMess and its botnet as unknown Golang malware. Based on its unique attack characteristics and sophisticated tactics, 360 Security Brain became the first domestic entity to officially designate it as an APT group. Three defining APT attributes align with WellMess' operations: Advanced (using complex Golang-based cross-platform weapons), Persistent (long-term target control), and Threatening (state-sponsored coordination). The naming derives from Golang's gopher mascot and "Mess" homophonic with "Mise" (chaos). Analysis suggests the core function name "WellMess" potentially originates from "WelcomeMessage," while symbolizing intended disruption. Technical analysis reveals WellMess' three-phase attack chain: 1) Supply chain compromise via malicious VPN servers exploiting client update vulnerabilities (SRC-2020-281), 2) Perimeter intrusion through vulnerability exploitation and compromised vendor credentials, 3) Post-exploitation activities including WellMess_Botlib implantation, lateral movement, and proxy tunneling. Notably, their 2017-2019 campaigns targeted critical network infrastructure providers, enabling potential cascading national security impacts through single-point breaches. Two primary attack vectors were identified: WellVpn (VPN client exploit delivering WellMess_Downloader) and WellServ (server infiltration using Golang/.NET backdoors). Temporal analysis of C2 communications (UTC+0) and sample compilation timestamps suggests systematic operational patterns, though attribution remains inconclusive due to lack of historical pattern matches.
