Shadow Over Central Asia GoldenEagle APT C 34 Group Attack Activities Exposed  
Background HackingTeam was one of the few companies that sold commercial cyber weapons worldwide. On July 5 2015 HackingTeam suffered a massive data breach which exposed nearly all of its engineered vulnerabilities and backdoor product codes. The leak included unpublished 0day vulnerabilities for Flash Windows fonts IE Chrome Word PPT Excel Android covering most desktop computers and over half of smartphones. The leaked cyber weapons were widely exploited by hackers leading to HackingTeam's eventual bankruptcy and acquisition. After 2015 HackingTeam-related activities suddenly disappeared. In 2018 during the "Kerch Strait" crisis between Ukraine and Russia 360 Advanced Threat Response Team first discovered an APT attack targeting Russia globally. The attackers prepared a decoy document with Russian-language employee survey content. Based on the document's content the attack targeted medical institutions under the Russian Presidential Office. Considering the targeted medical institutions' functional characteristics we named this APT operation "Poison Needle". While we couldn't confirm the motivation or identity behind "Poison Needle" the specific background of the targeted medical institutions indicated clear directional targeting. The timing during the sensitive "Kerch Strait" crisis also suggested potential unknown political intentions. We found that "Poison Needle" used Flash 0day vulnerability CVE-2018-15982 with backdoor programs suspected to originate from Italian cyber arms merchant HackingTeam suggesting the APT group behind it frequently purchased commercial cyber weapons. Multiple clues indicate HackingTeam's business never disappeared sparking our interest in tracking HackingTeam weapons again. Through correlation tracking of HackingTeam weapons we unexpectedly discovered an undisclosed Russian-speaking APT group primarily active in Central Asia especially Kazakhstan. As this was the first global discovery and disclosure we named the group GoldenEagle (APT-C-34) referencing Central Asia's falconry traditions. Summary During research on HackingTeam backdoors we identified more in-the-wild attacks using HackingTeam backdoors through 360's big data. Through homology analysis and correlation expansion we discovered various backdoor types. After a year of observation and in-depth investigation we uncovered more details gradually forming a complete profile of GoldenEagle (APT-C-34). GoldenEagle (APT-C-34) victims are widely distributed across Central Asia mainly in Kazakhstan spanning education aerospace government media and other sectors. Some victims had Chinese backgrounds involving China-Kazakhstan cooperation projects with a few located in northwestern China. The group is suspected to have government entity support. Technically besides traditional backdoors GoldenEagle (APT-C-34) acquired commercial spyware from HackingTeam and NSO. The group's HackingTeam backdoor version 10.3.0 matched the "Poison Needle" operation. Attack methods included traditional social engineering and physical delivery via USB drives. There were also signs of using special reconnaissance equipment for direct eavesdropping and signal acquisition. Attack Scope Analysis shows most victims concentrated in Kazakhstan across education government research media military religious groups dissidents and diplomats. Chinese-affected personnel mainly included students educational institutions and project teams in Kazakhstan with very few victims in northwestern China involving government workers. On the group's C&C servers we found numerous folders named after Kazakh cities covering major urban centers: Aktay (Aktau) Karaganda Kokshetay Oral (Uralsk) Oskemen Semey Atyrau Jezkazgan Kyzylorda Petropavl Taldykorgan Taraz and Shymkent. Each city-named folder contained HackingTeam backdoors with different configurations for regional targets. Backdoors encrypted collected victim data before uploading to C&C servers with individual victim folders for identification. Typical Victim Analysis Decrypted uploads revealed extensive document theft: Chinese victims included personnel from educational institutions in Kazakhstan. Kazakh research institution victims had stolen files related to Kazakhstan-Russia joint projects. Education and research union victims had meeting records stolen. Attack Methodology Analysis GoldenEagle (APT-C-34) employed social engineering physical access attacks and radio hardware devices. Social Engineering Attacks The group created decoy documents/images (EXE/SRC files) disguised as Huawei router manuals fake resumes and Samsung phone guides. Some install scripts added registry entries for persistence. Physical Access Attacks The group used USB drives containing malware install scripts (install*.bat files) and HackingTeam physical kits pre-boot malware installers for Win/Mac/Linux. Radio Surveillance The group acquired "YURION" hardware from a Russian defense contractor specializing in radio interception devices. Core Backdoor Analysis Backdoors were modified from legitimate software developed in-house or purchased commercially. Legitimate Remote Software Modification TeamViewer Hijacker: Modified TeamViewer QuickSupport via DLL hijacking hiding windows and stealing ID/password through API hooks (ShowWindow/SetWindowTextW). Data sent via GET requests to C&C hxxp://.ru//get.php. Additional modules (msmm.exe/msmn.exe) performed keylogging. RMS Hijacker: Similar approach targeting Russian remote control software RMS. Self-developed Harpoon (Гарпун) Backdoor A Delphi-based backdoor with comprehensive functions: keylogging clipboard capture screenshots Skype/Google Hangouts call recording file exfiltration FTP data exfiltration remote command execution auto-update and self-destruct. Configuration files specified FTP servers collection intervals (BInterval=10 SInterval=60) and target file types (.xls .doc .pdf). HackingTeam Commercial Backdoor Purchase The group acquired HackingTeam's Remote Control System (RCS) v10.3.0 (post-2015 leak) including Windows/Android clients. Windows variants used VMP protection and certificate signatures persisting via registry (NVIDIAControlPanel). Offline installers supported Win/Mac/Linux via USB. Android variants included 17 modules for call recording camera access IM chat extraction GPS tracking and password theft using Framaroot exploits. Attribution Analysis Infrastructure and victims primarily located in Kazakhstan suggest state-linked operations targeting domestic intelligence with collateral Chinese targets. Connection to Poison Needle Both Russian-speaking groups used HackingTeam v10.3.0 but no direct operational links. Kazakhstan-HackingTeam Ties 2015 leaks revealed Kazakh intelligence purchased HackingTeam tools with emails discussing 360 AV detection issues potentially targeting Chinese entities. Partnership with NSO Group The group possessed Pegasus training docs and contracts (2018) indicating iOS/Android 0day capabilities. Technical Documentation Harpoon v5.0 manuals reference Kazakh cities/government agencies suggesting state-sponsored development. Associated Identities Malware signatures linked to Russian-speaking developers (Evn Bi*kyy Ir Kan Yuin Og Vlad**ich) with LinkedIn profiles matching technical roles. Conclusion 360 Advanced Threat Response Team discovered GoldenEagle (APT-C-34) via HackingTeam weapon tracking exposing a highly resourced state-sponsored group combining in-house development and commercial cyber arms (HackingTeam/NSO). This highlights ongoing proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities posing global threats.
