Kaspersky Exposes New HackerforHire Group Targeting European Law Firms  
Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky revealed during a webinar today that it has discovered a new hacker-for-hire group apparently active for nearly a decade. According to Kaspersky malware analyst Vicente Diaz, the group designated by Kaspersky as Deceptikons primarily targets law firms and fintech companies. Kaspersky researchers stated the group appears focused on stealing commercial and financial secrets rather than government-related information. Diaz noted most targets are located in Europe with occasional victims in Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Jordan, and Egypt. Deceptikons' recent attacks include a 2019 spear-phishing campaign against European law firms deploying malicious PowerShell scripts to infect hosts. The Russian security company clarified in a written report: "The group is not technically sophisticated and has not deployed zero-day exploits to our knowledge." Kaspersky described the group's infrastructure and malware as "clever rather than technically advanced" with focus on persistence in infected hosts. Most attacks follow similar patterns starting with spear-phishing emails containing maliciously modified LNK shortcut files. When victims download and interact with the files (e.g., clicking), the shortcuts download and execute PowerShell-based backdoor trojans. Diaz stated Kaspersky will publish a more comprehensive technical report on Deceptikons' activities in coming weeks. This marks the second major hacker-for-hire group exposure in 2023 following Citizen Lab's revelation of Indian firm BellTroX InfoTech Services as Dark Basin APT. However, Kaspersky has not linked Deceptikons to any real-world entities - at least for now.
