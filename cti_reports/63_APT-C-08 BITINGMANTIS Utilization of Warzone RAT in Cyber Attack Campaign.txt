APT-C-08 BITINGMANTIS Utilization of Warzone RAT in Cyber Attack Campaign  
Warzone RAT is a commercial Trojan developed in pure C/C++ that appeared online in 2018 through subscription-based sales. It supports all Windows versions and provides multiple remote control functions including password harvesting, arbitrary program execution, keylogging, remote desktop control, file transfer, and camera activation. Recent 360 Security Brain monitoring revealed that APT-C-08 (BITINGMANTIS) deployed Warzone RAT in late 2020 attacks targeting Chinese social science researchers specializing in South Asian relations. Attackers delivered malicious self-extracting executables disguised as academic conference invitation letters, ultimately implanting Warzone RAT for remote control. The attack chain involved a self-extracting executable (MD5:98b9ee58f23e50a27cc8fd93de2ef08a) creating %Temp%\ckz_****\zip\ directory to release three files: onedrv.exe (VB-written launcher), winword.exe (Warzone RAT loader), and decoy file.pdf. The loader (MD5:626d639ecf5972f7cea034b18dbee0f4) decrypts shellcode executing PELoader (MD5:abdfe73b334851b5202059a02eae58da), which dynamically resolves APIs to load Warzone RAT (MD5:c9430ce90e3dc79287251f69e5a872a8) in memory. The RAT implements UAC bypass via COM hijacking (sdclt.exe for Win10) or registry manipulation (HKCU\SOFTWARE\hive_rptls\install) for non-Win10 systems, establishes persistence through startup entries and registry modifications, and communicates with C2 server 192.236.249.173:2709 using RC4 encryption (key:"warzone160"). Functional analysis reveals 35 control commands including process manipulation, file transfer, keylogging, and camera control. Infrastructure overlaps with previous BITINGMANTIS campaigns (C2:192.236.249.173:2706 in Operation Monsoon) confirm attribution. Despite multiple exposures, the group continues leveraging commercial malware and public infrastructure, requiring sustained vigilance. 360's enterprise security products including Threat Intelligence Cloud and Sandbox Cloud provide detection coverage against these attacks.
