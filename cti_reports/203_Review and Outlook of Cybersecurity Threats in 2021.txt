Review and Outlook of Cybersecurity Threats in 2021
The year 2021 marked the beginning of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period. At the Cybersecurity Industry Development Forum held during the National Cybersecurity Awareness Week, Antiy proposed three major historical tasks for the cybersecurity field during this period: systematically reshaping cybersecurity defense and national security capabilities; comprehensively enhancing the security protection level of critical information infrastructure to effectively ensure the digital transformation of the national economic system; and fully meeting citizens' demands for personal information and privacy protection. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated profound adjustments in global economic, political, technological, and governance patterns. In this era of increasing instability and uncertainty, scientific policy-making and coordinated development can transform crises into opportunities. Antiy created the 2021 Global APT Attack Campaigns and Organizational Geographical Distribution Map to reveal the surging "conspiracies" of unknown APT activities and the evident "open strategies" of known APT groups. The implementation of the Regulations on the Security Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure since September 1, 2021, represents a crucial measure in cybersecurity demand-side reform. Following the Data Security Law effective from June 10, 2021, and the Personal Information Protection Law effective from November 1, 2021, China's legal framework for data governance has been fundamentally established. This report summarizes Antiy's observations and perspectives on APT attacks, ransomware, mining malware, phishing emails, data breaches, supply chain security, and threat generalization. Regarding APT activities: Cybersecurity has become a critical issue concerning national sovereignty and development interests. More unknown APT campaigns show covert "conspiracies" while known groups demonstrate overt strategies. Attackers continuously update tactics using spear phishing and vulnerability exploitation. Mobile device attacks have become常态化, with Middle Eastern and South Asian groups demonstrating advanced threats. Loose intelligence referencing leads to unreliable attribution results. Ransomware trends include triple extortion tactics, non-encrypting variants, and destructive payloads. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models promote organizational specialization and operational efficiency. Targeted ransomware attacks now reach APT-level sophistication. Mining malware operators increasingly target cloud infrastructure while considering expanding into ransomware or data theft operations. Phishing campaigns exhibit progressive targeting tactics, with email auto-forwarding functions becoming covert exfiltration channels. Data breach incidents show "three highs" in frequency, volume, and impact severity. IoT threat generalization continues expanding, with smart devices becoming new attack vectors across healthcare, home automation, and critical infrastructure sectors.
