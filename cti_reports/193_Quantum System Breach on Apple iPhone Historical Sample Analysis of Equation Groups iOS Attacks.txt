Quantum System Breach on Apple iPhone Historical Sample Analysis of Equation Groups iOS Attacks
1. Overview: A2PT Sample Puzzle Covering Smart Terminals Over the past two decades, global critical information infrastructure operators, security vendors, and researchers have faced the significant challenge of countering network attacks launched by intelligence agencies such as NSA. Antiy CERT defines these activities employing unimaginable technological resources as A2PT (Advanced Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks, with multiple incidents traced to NSA's Equation Group. Revealing A2PT attack samples and processes has become an analytical relay race more arduous than a marathon, completing at least three baton passes: The first phase (2010-2013) revealed Stuxnet-Flame-Duqu-Gauss connections through Snowden leaks; The second phase exposed Equation Group's hard disk firmware attacks and atomic operation patterns; The third phase leveraged Shadow Brokers leaks for deeper analysis. The April 11 CCIA report "Historical Review of US Intelligence Agencies' Cyber Attacks" comprehensively documents this struggle. Key analytical achievements include establishing Equation Group's cross-platform capabilities across Windows, Linux, Solaris, and MacOS. While mobile platform samples remained elusive despite ANT catalog clues like DROPOUTJEEP, persistent efforts enabled subsequent discoveries. Following Kaspersky's June 2023 "Operation Triangulation" report on iOS zero-click exploits, we supplement previous findings. Our analyzed historical samples differ by utilizing Equation's QUANTUM system for browser vulnerability exploitation rather than iMessage vectors. 2. Sample Analysis The samples constitute iOS low-level trojans comprising execution payloads and backdoors. The payload (masquerading as regquerystr.exe) performs environmental checks (kernel version 2.6.32-358, UID 0 privileges) before deploying /tmp/mvld via launchctl load. String encryption employs XOR (0x47) and multiplicative (0x1D) algorithms, contrasting Equation's PC platform cryptographic rigor. Decrypted configurations reveal: - Gzip-compressed secondary payload (/usr/sbin/mvld) - Persistence mechanism mimicking notifyd and locationd services - C2 infrastructure (lp1: *******[.]com, lp2: 80.*.*.*) The mvld backdoor (117KB Mach-O) exhibits DoubleFantasy lineage through: - /private/var/tmp/.swapfile.tmp logging - Network reconnaissance (Google/Yahoo/Apple domain connectivity checks) - Credential harvesting (getpwuid, /etc/passwd parsing) - 13 command codes (0x42 packet verification, 0x4B file exfiltration, 0x70 C2 update) - FAID identifier ace02468bdf13579 matching Shadow Brokers' SecondDate 3. Homology Analysis Cryptographic consistency (0x47 XOR key), data collection formats, and command structures demonstrate Equation Group's operational fingerprints across platforms: - String decryption algorithms mirror Windows/Solaris samples - Information taxonomy (MAC 000, IP 002, Timezone 038) maintains cross-platform uniformity - Command code architecture (0x75 heartbeat adjustment, 0x80 file deletion) preserves functional parity 4. QUANTUM System Attack Mechanism The QUANTUM system (exposed by Snowden in 2013) enables "God-mode" attacks through: 1. Network infrastructure compromise (routers/gateways) 2. X-Keyscore-driven target identification (IP/IMSI/account markers) 3. FOXACID exploit delivery preceding legitimate server responses 4. Browser vulnerability chaining (CVE-2014-1349/4466) 5. GIF-header camouflaged payload (regquerystr.exe) insertion Key characteristics: - Preemptive attack packet delivery - Encrypted non-interactive traffic patterns - Single-use exploit deployment avoiding re-detection - Gateway memory-resident implants evading traditional hunting 5. A2PT Vulnerability Ecosystem Equation Group's arsenal relies on: 5.1 Vulnerability Stockpiling - VEP-processed 0days with NOBUS (Nobody But Us) retention - Cryptographic backdoors (Dual_EC_DRBG, Crypto AG compromise) - Service-side exploits (EternalBlue-EasyBee-EternalSynergy) - Client-side browser vulnerabilities (Chrome/Firefox/Safari) 5.2 Acquisition Channels - IT vendor collusion (Dell/HP/Cisco implant documentation) - Conference recruitment (RSA/Black Hat/DEFCON) - Pwn2Own competition alignment (ZDI vulnerability brokering) - Bug bounty programs (Hack the Pentagon/HackerOne) - Commercial spyware procurement (Pegasus/Galileo) 6. Conclusion: Mobile A2PT Challenges The analyzed iOS samples complete Equation Group's cross-platform capability matrix, demonstrating QUANTUM's browser-based attack vector beyond iMessage exploits. Mobile devices present heightened risks due to: - Personal data concentration (location/communications/biometrics) - Sensor proliferation (accelerometer/camera/microphone) - Expanded attack surface (Bluetooth/WiFi/cellular interfaces) - Defense asymmetry (consumer-grade vs nation-state capabilities) Countermeasures require: - Supply chain security hardening - Cross-environment detection capabilities - Active defense mechanisms integration - Full-cycle threat hunting frameworks Antiy remains committed to enhancing mobile security through: - Malware detection engines - Vulnerability mitigation strategies - Advanced threat intelligence sharing - Systemic defense architecture development [1] CCIA Report: Historical Review of US Intelligence Agencies' Cyber Attacks [2] Kaspersky: Equation: The Death Star of Malware Galaxy [3] Antiy: Equation Group Malware Platform Analysis ...
