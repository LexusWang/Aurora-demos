APT-C-53 (Gamaredon) New Wave of DDoS Attack Campaign Analysis
Recent monitoring by 360 Security Brain revealed intensified cyberattack activities associated with APT-C-53 (Gamaredon), including the deployment of open-source DDoS Trojan "LOIC" for DDoS attacks. During surveillance of APT-C-53's network attacks, we identified multiple attack chains: phishing emails, remote template injection execution, SFX self-extracting archive malicious script execution, Wiper malware deployment, and registry-based payload persistence through scheduled tasks. Through continuous investigation, we captured multiple APT-C-53 attack campaigns along with related samples and C2 servers. Monitoring these C2 servers revealed several instances distributing the .NET-compiled open-source DDoS tool LOIC between March 4-5, 2022. C&C domains involved in DDoS task distribution include: decree.maizuko.**, caciques.gloritapa.**, delicate.maizuko.**, jealousy.jump.artisola.**, dense.gitrostan.**, decision.lotorgas.**, decency.maizuko.**, junior.jacket.artisola.**, defective88.maizuko.**, deception.lotorgas.**, destination.delight.coffiti.**, cachinate.gloritapa.**, January.josie.artisola.**, defective19.maizuko.**. DDoS sample details: MD5 5486BCE58C5D30C7B3F940079C33B95F, CompileTimestamp 2022/3/4 21:53, FileSize 156.16K. Attackers hardcoded target IP addresses and ports into the configuration for specified DDoS attacks. 360 Security Brain initially observed APT-C-53's DoS attack intent, and based on Gamaredon's historical pattern of deploying DDoS tools, we assess this LOIC deployment likely signals preparation for new DDoS campaigns.
