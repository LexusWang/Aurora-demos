In the first half of 2022, the 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute discovered an attack campaign originating from the Lazarus group. This campaign masqueraded as Alibaba-related components to deliver malicious payloads associated with the NukeSped family. The subsequent payloads primarily focused on exfiltrating target-related file information, indicating an attack targeting specific sectors or demographics. Characterized by high precision and stealth, this operation has currently affected users related to the South Korean software company Hancom Secure. The group utilized forged Alibaba-related programs and registered services to achieve persistence for the counterfeit components, involving fake files such as alibabaprotect.db and alibabaconf.bat. These components deployed a subsequent payload, HttpUploader, designed primarily to upload files from specific user directories based on payload parameters. Notably, both the C&C address and the upload directory were passed as parameters to the forged components, achieving separation of critical information from the payload. This Lazarus operation is linked to the NukeSped family. Most malware loading NukeSped checks command-line parameters and proceeds with malicious execution only upon receiving the expected parametersâ€”a common characteristic of this malware family's loader. The forged payload loading consisted of 6 parameters, consistent with previously disclosed counts. The second parameter was a fixed string S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA, the third was the C&C address, and the fourth was the local upload path. Analysis of samples in the same directory revealed operations leveraging the PCAudit service to launch Mimikatz for decryption. It is inferred that the decrypted data corresponded to local files designated for upload via payload parameters. Previously disclosed NukeSped components also exhibited Mimikatz decryption operations. The APT-C-26 (Lazarus) group demonstrated clear objectives and highly stealthy tactics in this attack. C&C details and upload paths were parameterized, and subsequent payloads operated entirely in-memory without disk residency (fileless). The primary goal was the collection of valuable information. Following completion of this targeted information gathering, related follow-up actions cannot be ruled out, warranting significant attention.
