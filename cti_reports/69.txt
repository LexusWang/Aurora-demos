APT-C-47 Volatile Cedar Attack Campaign Leveraging ClickOnce Technology Disclosed  
ClickOnce represents a Microsoft software deployment technology enabling self-updating Windows applications with minimal user interaction. During Black Hat USA 2019, CISA experts revealed attack methodologies exploiting .appref-ms extension files. This technique differs from conventional malware implantation by leveraging Microsoft's installation design for malicious inducement. Recent 360 Security Brain detections uncovered multiple ClickOnce attack campaigns traced to an undisclosed North Korean Peninsula-based APT group targeting entities and individuals affiliated with the region. Designated as "Volatile Cedar" (APT-C-47) through homophonic reference to its technical characteristics, this group exhibits activity dating back to 2018 with no prior public disclosures. The attack chain initiates through phishing emails masquerading as security plugin updates containing malicious .appref-ms deployment files. Three customized phishing domains (*****ce.com, ******n.com, *****k.com) impersonate different email systems. Final decoy documents remain encrypted Word files with low enticement value, emphasizing social engineering through fake security module installations. Malicious ClickOnce executables disguise as mathematical CLI calculators while embedding payload loaders. The banner_M.jpg component decrypts res.jpg configuration files containing C2 addresses (stage parameters: M/2/3/4), AV evasion logic (16 security product checks), and AES decryption keys (148780657362178FD5ADD0CFB99EFF8BC68C72EE0B438E64EDF643EB2592D7BB). Payloads employ XOR encryption (key: 9D88B3FA) layered with RSA-encrypted AES keys for C2 communication. Subsequent GO-language backdoor modules perform system reconnaissance (MAC/hostname/OS version collection), persistence mechanisms (Startup directory placement), and DLL hijacking via msftedit.dll. The modular framework supports multiple operational commands including file exfiltration (!get), remote execution (!exec), and network tunneling (rtel). C2 instructions validate through numeric authentication before enabling full functionality. 360's threat intelligence confirms APT-C-47's operational uniqueness through ClickOnce weaponization and hybrid C#/Go toolchain usage. 360 Security Brain, Intelligence Cloud, and Sandbox Cloud products provide comprehensive detection coverage against this campaign.
