Operation Sky Hunting Latest Attack Campaign of CNC APT-C-48 Group Exposed
CNC (APT-C-48) is a threat actor first observed in 2019, named after the "cnc_client" PDB path found in their remote access trojan. This group primarily targets China's military-industrial and educational sectors. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, CNC conducted attacks against medical institutions using pandemic-themed decoy documents and phishing websites. Recent monitoring by 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute revealed multiple intelligence theft campaigns targeting Chinese scientific research institutions, universities, and aerospace-related entities around June 2023, coinciding with China's aerospace developments. We have named this campaign "Operation Sky Hunting". The attacks employed two distinct methodologies: Attack Vector 1 follows a multi-stage process leveraging multiple GitHub accounts for data transmission. It begins with a phishing site mimicking 360 Browser's Flash update prompt, delivering FakeFlashInstaller (NSIS-packed malware) that downloads datA577N.exe from GitHub. This dropper achieves persistence via scheduled tasks, collects victim IP/process information using checkip.dyndns.org and WTSEnumerateProcessesW, then uploads Base64-encoded data to GitHub. The final payload is a modified GRAT2 RAT (RAT_ckh) that retrieves C2 configuration from GitHub using AES-encrypted Base64 data. The RAT implements multilingual commands including German "herunterladen" (download), Japanese "hosutomei" (hostname), and Italian "chisono" (whoami). Attack Vector 2 demonstrates network-aware behavior: malware checks connectivity via baidu.com ICMP probes, adapting its operation based on network availability. When offline, it spreads via removable drives as "中国***成立100周年普通纪念币.exe", harvesting documents from recent files and LNK shortcuts. Upon network detection, it establishes reverse shell using GitHub-hosted C2 configurations or fallback IP 213.227.154.175. The group's GitHub infrastructure includes accounts autoid-generate (payload storage), UP-567890 (data collection), and danlerz (dynamic C2 configuration), with testing activities traced back to January 2023. Technical analysis reveals code similarities with historical CNC samples, including vcpkg development environment traces and shared C2 infrastructure (194.32.76.124). The TTP evolution shows continuous refinement from 2019 variants containing basic reverse shell functionality (PDB paths like D:\Project\C++\communicator\Release\communicator.pdb) to current encrypted C2 and ICMP-based detection. Notably, MD5 3d6aab4e4e055b9c50837c6adc97e060 links to APT "幼象" (Young Elephant) described in Antiy's 2020 "Operation Origami" report. Further infrastructure analysis reveals domain patterns overlapping with SideWinder APT's phishing infrastructure, suggesting potential collaboration or shared resources between CNC, Young Elephant, and SideWinder threat actors.
