Latest Turla ComRAT Backdoor Utilizes Gmail Web UI to Receive Commands  
ESET researchers have discovered a new version of Turla's ComRAT backdoor that uses Gmail's web interface to stealthily receive commands and exfiltrate sensitive data from victims. Turla, an elite cyberespionage group allegedly linked to Russia's FSB intelligence agency and also known as "Snake," "Uroboros," "Venomous Bear," "Group 88," and "Iron Hunter," has been active since 2008, targeting foreign government entities, embassies, and military organizations. The latest ComRAT iteration employs cookies stored in its configuration to connect to Gmail's web interface, checking the inbox to download encrypted email attachments containing commands. Researchers note this version is significantly more sophisticated than predecessors, built on a different codebase and compiled in November 2019, demonstrating Turla's ability to maintain persistent access for years. ComRAT (aka Agent.BTZ), one of Turla's oldest tools dating back to 2007, gained notoriety after breaching Pentagon networks in 2008. Since 2017, it has attacked at least three government agencies including a national parliament network and two foreign ministries. Kaspersky previously reported Turla's weaponization of JavaScript KopiLuwak malware via a .NET-based dropper called Topinambour. In March, ESET documented Turla's watering hole attacks targeting Armenian government and civilian websites, deploying new malware components NetFlash and PyFlash.
