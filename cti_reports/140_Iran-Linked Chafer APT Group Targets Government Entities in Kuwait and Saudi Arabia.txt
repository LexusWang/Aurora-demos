Iran-Linked Chafer APT Group Targets Government Entities in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia  
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Chafer APT targeting critical infrastructure in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. A detailed report from Bitdefender addresses Iranian-linked cyber espionage activities against Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian critical infrastructure. The campaign was carried out by Chafer APT (also known as APT39 or Remix Kitten), an Iran-linked group operational since at least mid-2014, specializing in data theft malware distribution with a focus on surveillance of organizations and individual tracking. The APT group primarily targets Middle Eastern telecommunications and travel sectors to gather intelligence related to Iran’s geopolitical interests. Researchers stated: "The analyzed campaign’s victims align with this actor’s preferred patterns, such as aviation transportation and government entities in the Middle East. Forensic clues suggest objectives of data exploration and exfiltration, evidenced by tools like Navicat, WinSCP in unusual locations (e.g., %WINDOWS%\ime\en-us-ime), or SmartFtpPasswordDecryptor on victim systems." Attackers employed multiple tools, including living-off-the-land techniques and custom backdoors, complicating attribution. Campaigns against Kuwaiti and Saudi entities shared overlapping stages but exhibited higher sophistication in Kuwait, where attackers created user accounts for internal malicious operations using tools like Mimikatz and CrackMapExec for credential harvesting and lateral movement. Most operations occurred on Fridays and Saturdays, coinciding with Middle Eastern weekends. Saudi-focused attacks relied heavily on social engineering to deploy RATs similar to those used against Kuwait and Turkey. Bitdefender noted: "The Saudi Arabian cases were less exhaustive, possibly due to limited exploitation success or unproductive reconnaissance. Forensic evidence suggests the same actor orchestrated both campaigns, though lateral movement traces were absent in Saudi operations." These campaigns underscore Iranian-linked APT groups’ intensified cyber espionage activities across the Middle East, highlighting their expanding global targeting of governments and organizations.
