StrongPity APT Group Targets Turkey and Syria  
Bitdefender researchers recently discovered that the APT group StrongPity has been targeting victims in Turkey and Syria. StrongPity selectively infected victims using a watering hole attack strategy, leveraging trojanized popular tools including file archivers, file recovery programs, remote connection applications, utilities, and even security software, while deploying a three-layer C&C infrastructure to hinder analysis. Investigators found the attackers showed particular interest in Kurdish communities. One operation appeared to start on October 1, 2019, coinciding with Turkey's "Operation Peace Spring" military offensive in northeastern Syria. While no direct evidence links StrongPity to supporting Turkish military operations, the victim profile and sample timestamps present an intriguing coincidence. KONNI Uses Malicious Excel Files to Steal User Information AnLab ASEC collected malicious Excel files used by the APT group KONNI. The files lure users into enabling macros, after which a second Excel file is downloaded displaying court ruling content titled "Violation of Access Sales Law Requires Fine Payment," followed by another macro activation request. When macros in the second file are enabled, sequentially executed downloaded files from the first Excel file harvest user information and download additional payloads. Kimsuky Conducts Attacks Using COVID-19 Themes EST Security recently observed Kimsuky leveraging COVID-19-themed documents in attacks. The group employs wsf-type malicious scripts containing Base64-encoded COVID-19-related HWP documents and malicious DLL binaries. When the HWP document is displayed, the DLL file is created to initiate infection. The malware attempts C2 server communication, transmitting the infected computer's MAC address and OS information. New Mac Ransomware Spreads via Pirated Installers Researchers identified malicious pirated Little Snitch installers on Russian forums distributing new Mac ransomware. The installer contains legitimate Little Snitch components in /Users/Shared/, a "patch" executable, and a post-installation shell script loading ransomware. The script moves "patch" to Little Snitch-related locations, renaming it "CrashReporter" (masquerading as macOS's legitimate Crash Reporter), deletes itself, launches Little Snitch, but does not initiate encryption. A separate malicious installer for Mixed In Key 8 DJ software spreads ransomware across hard drives and establishes persistence via launch agents/daemon plist files. Xerox Corporation Hit by Maze Ransomware Maze ransomware operators compromised Xerox Corporation's systems, exfiltrating files before encryption. Xerox, a U.S.-based document technology company operating in 160+ countries, has not publicly disclosed the attack. However, Maze operators released screenshots showing encrypted hosts on Xerox-managed domains. Microsoft Patches Two Codec Vulnerabilities Microsoft released out-of-band security updates addressing two remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1425 and CVE-2020-1457) in the Windows Codecs Library, affecting only Windows 10 and Server 2019. Attackers could exploit these flaws via specially crafted image files. Opening malformed images in applications using Windows codecs enables arbitrary code execution. Updates were silently deployed via Windows Store.
