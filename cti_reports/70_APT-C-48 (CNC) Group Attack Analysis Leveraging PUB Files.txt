APT-C-48 (CNC) is a threat actor first identified in 2019, named for the "cnc_client" strings found in its remote control trojan's PDB paths. The group primarily targets China's military-industrial and education sectors. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China last year, CNC conducted attacks against healthcare organizations using fabricated pandemic-related documents and phishing sites. This year, we have repeatedly captured the group's persistent attacks against multiple Chinese research institutions. Recently, we intercepted another CNC campaign targeting domestic scientific research entities. Attack Process Analysis: In this operation, CNC employed the following attack chain: The delivered file masqueraded as a publication with a ".pub" extension. Malicious macros within the PUB file downloaded subsequent programs and scripts from a server for local execution. Though the BAT file was not acquired, we assess it likely initiated taskhost.exe based on the overall workflow. Taskhost.exe: Upon execution, taskhost.exe employs "IsDebuggerPresent" and checks for hooks on "CreateProcessA" to evade analysis before self-terminating. After passing these checks, it copies itself to "C:\Media\taskhosts.exe" and uses the "ITaskService" COM component to create scheduled tasks for persistence. The malware tests network connectivity by pinging "mail.163.cn". When online, it decrypts the C2 server port through triple Base64 encoding. It collects adapter information via "ipconfig", uploads the data to the server, and deletes the file. Finally, it establishes a reverse shell to the remote server via named pipes. Phishing Site Correlation: During phishing site analysis, we discovered a site sharing the same source ID as the aforementioned sample. The phishing page uses URL-encoded obfuscation for critical code. When deobfuscated, the code reveals that upon user login, SMTPjs sends captured credentials from "hr@skconsultants.in" to "dhlresultbox@gmail.com". "hr@skconsultants.in" belongs to an Indian HR recruitment firm. While the target industries overlap with those described in our "Operation SkyHunt" report, further analysis shows this email targeted diverse sectors across multiple countries, inconsistent with APT patterns. No other connections to CNC were found, suggesting coincidental overlap. We cannot rule out APT groups purchasing target data from underground sources. Email suffixes associated with "hr@skconsultants.in" include: @troostwijk.ch, @selux.de, @steinborn.com, @sartex.com.tn, @eiffeloptic.cz, @hmm21.com, @kela.be, @von-poll.com, @eltrade.com, @von-poll.com, @biro-d.cz, @forteldesign.cz, @ltt.com.pl, @kbfg.com, @lgchem.com, @pidilidi.cz, @kastens-knauer.de. Attribution Evidence: CNC exhibits consistent preference for COM components when creating scheduled tasks. As noted in "Operation SkyHunt", CNC developers integrate vcpkg in their environment—a characteristic preserved in this sample. The development paths remain highly consistent with historical patterns. Both the vcpkg paths and PDB files reveal the same username "user" across development devices, confirming CNC's involvement. Conclusion: South Asian APT groups frequently weaponize document files for social engineering. While this attack follows that pattern, it notably uses PUB files—an uncommon Microsoft Office Publisher format typically used by specialized professionals. This payload choice reflects attackers' growing diversification beyond conventional formats (DOC, XLS, RTF) and demonstrates tailored targeting beyond spear-phishing and document content.
