FBI Alerts Ongoing GRU Cyber Attacks Targeting US Critical Infrastructure  
As the 2020 US presidential election approaches, Russia's military intelligence agency GRU has resurfaced on the FBI's radar. In May 2020, the FBI warned that APT28 (also known as "Fancy Bear"), a cyber unit under GRU, had conducted extensive cyber attacks against US government entities and critical infrastructure from December 2018 to May 2020, with the Department of Energy being a primary target. Recent FBI statements confirm these attacks persist. Since early 2020, GRU-affiliated groups including APT28 have escalated targeted cyber operations across multiple sectors, raising concerns about potential election interference. APT28, operational since the mid-2000s, employs 0day exploits, spear-phishing emails, and malware to target governments and military agencies of Russia's political adversaries, notably accused of interfering in the 2016 US election. The FBI's May alert revealed APT28 used password spraying and spear-phishing to breach US infrastructure, with technical evidence linking attacks to IP addresses previously associated with energy sector probes. Dragos researcher Joe Slowik noted APT28's focus on energy marks a strategic shift, marking its first confirmed US critical infrastructure campaign in years. The Department of Energy's compromised security poses significant national defense risks, given its role in weapons development and energy policy. Recent FBI disclosures confirm GRU's ongoing activities, while NSA reports exposed SandWorm's exploitation of Exim mail server vulnerabilities in May 2020. In July 2020, a joint advisory by CISA, NCSC, CSE, and NSA revealed APT29's use of WellMess malware against COVID-19 research facilities. With escalating GRU operations, US intelligence officials increasingly suspect Russian attempts to influence the 2020 election, mirroring 2016 interference tactics. Though the FBI states no direct evidence links recent APT28 intrusions to election meddling, FireEye analyst Reed emphasized: "The US remains Russia's primary adversary."
