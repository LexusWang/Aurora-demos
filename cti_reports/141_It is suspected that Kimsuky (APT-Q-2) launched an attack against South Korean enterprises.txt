Group Background
Kimsuky, also known as Mystery Baby, Baby Coin, Smoke Screen, Black Banshe, etc., is internally tracked by QiAnXin as APT-Q-2. This APT group was publicly exposed in 2013, with its activities traced back to as early as 2012. Kimsuky mainly targets South Korea, focusing on sectors such as defense, education, energy, government, healthcare, and think tanks, with a primary objective of stealing confidential information. The group typically uses methods like social engineering, spear-phishing emails, and watering hole attacks to deliver malware. Their techniques are diverse, with tools developed for both Windows and Android platforms.

Incident Overview
Recently, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center discovered a batch of malware similar to historical Kimsuky samples. One of the samples deploys software signed by Korean software vendor BlueMoonSoft to mislead victims.

The backdoor sample within the malware connects to C2 servers using dynamic domain names. The primary functions of the backdoor include: collecting system and network configuration information from infected devices, downloading and executing subsequent payloads. The newer version of the backdoor checks at runtime whether the device's hostname is in an embedded target list; if not, it terminates immediately. The filtering list of hostnames includes the string “DANAM,” which likely refers to the South Korean company Danam, whose business covers electronics manufacturing, telecommunications, and defense industry.

Sandbox Analysis
The Dropper sample was uploaded to QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Sandbox (https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page) for preliminary analysis.

QiAnXin Sandbox Report Link	https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page/detail?type=file&id=AZXw93rcONZSmF3-9K4E
Sample Filename	BizboxAMessenger.exe
Sample MD5	920f408fdc80c5697739cda9cf9a4ca7
Sample Type	PE64 EXE
Sample Size	8.28 MB (8683520 bytes)

The sandbox gave the sample a malicious score of 10 based on comprehensive behavioral analysis.

The “Abnormal Behavior” section reveals some suspicious actions, such as renaming the sample’s path with a "~" suffix.

Executable files BMSGTray.exe and msbuild.bat are created.

Suspicious processes are also spawned, including the launch of BMSGTray.exe and msbuild.bat, invoking IconCache.mdf using regsvr32.exe, and deleting the sample file itself.

The “Process” section of the host behavior shows the relationships among these suspicious processes. Launching of BMSGTray.exe, IconCache.mdf, and the deletion of the renamed sample file are carried out by the main sample process, while msbuild.bat is started by the IconCache.mdf process.

Malicious Code Details
After execution, the sample’s main function main_main first calls main_ChangeCurrentExe to rename itself by appending a "~" to the path. This is for extracting embedded file data and enabling self-deletion.

It then extracts BMSGTray.exe and launches it. The file data for BMSGTray.exe is located at offset 0x149AE0 in the Dropper, with a data length of 0x6F0110. This executable is digitally signed by software company BlueMoonSoft, with a signature date of February 21, 2025.

Using a similar method, it extracts the backdoor to "%AppData%\IconCache.mdf". The backdoor data resides at offset 0x111CE0 in the Dropper, with a data length of 0x37E00. Additionally, the Dropper appends random-length and random-content data after IconCache.mdf. Then it uses regsvr32.exe to run the extracted IconCache.mdf. Without the appended random data, the MD5 of IconCache.mdf is d37569b238ec6c073a06a28bc665072c.

Finally, it calls main_SelfDelete1 to delete the renamed sample file.

Backdoor
ssh_config.dat (MD5: e8f5d4bbf96855f7f4ad0ff4d67efe5e) and IconCache.mdf (MD5: d37569b238ec6c073a06a28bc665072c) are the same backdoor program. Both share the same C&C communication pattern. Judging by the compilation time, the latter is a newer version, which builds upon the former by adding environment checks, persistence mechanisms, and a self-deletion routine.

C&C Communication
Taking ssh_config.dat as an example, the backdoor communicates with the C&C server via the URL hxxp://sudifo.ftp.sh/index.php, where sudifo.ftp.sh is a dynamic subdomain under ftp.sh. The backdoor sends data using a POST request in the following format:
a[9-byte random string]=[Field1]&b[9-byte random string]=[Field2]&c[9-byte random string]=[Field3]
The meanings of the three POST data fields are as follows:

Field	Description
1	Request type, with three possible values: "1", "2", and "3". Field1 contains the Base64-encoded string of the request type.
2	Victim ID, formatted as "A-[8-byte random string]" or "U-[8-byte random string]". Field2 contains the Base64-encoded string of the victim ID.
3	Data to be sent back to the C&C server. This field may be empty.

The victim ID consists of a prefix and a random string. If the current user has elevated privileges, the prefix is "A-" (i.e., admin); otherwise, it is "U-" (i.e., user). Once generated, the random string is saved in the alternate data stream "DDID" of the backdoor DLL file for later retrieval.

The three request types used by the backdoor to communicate with the C&C server correspond to the following functions:

Establishing Connection
Request type "1" is used to establish a connection with the server. If the response is not "live", the backdoor sleeps for 60 seconds before retrying.

Exfiltrating Collected Data
Request type "2" is used to send collected data back to the server. After establishing a connection, the backdoor executes the commands systeminfo and ipconfig /all to gather system and network information, and then uploads the output to the C&C server.

Fetching Follow-up Payload
Request type "3" is used to download an RC4-encrypted DLL payload from the server. If the server response is "fail", it indicates that the payload is currently unavailable. Otherwise, the response is decrypted, loaded into memory, and the exported function hello is invoked.

Additional Features
Compared with ssh_config.dat, IconCache.mdf adds environment checking, persistence setup, and a self-deletion routine.

The environment check is performed by comparing the infected device’s hostname with an internal target list. If the hostname matches one on the list, the backdoor proceeds with persistence setup and C&C communication. Otherwise, it self-deletes to erase traces of the infection.

The target hostname list includes DANAM, which may refer to the South Korean company DANAM. YDJUNG and GRKIM appear to be name abbreviations, while SECURITY, COMPUTERROOM, and 5F-ROOM suggest the attackers are interested in specific departments or rooms within an organization.

Persistence is achieved by creating a service named NewsUpdate using sc.exe.

For self-deletion, the backdoor drops a script %temp%\msbuild.bat to delete its files. Once deletion is complete, it calls TerminateProcess to end the process.

Other Malware
In addition to the backdoor sshd_conf.dat, the compressed archive also contains two other malicious programs. sshdc.exe requires two parameters: a session ID and a command line. It enables the execution of arbitrary commands in the specified user session. The malware first attempts to execute the command with high mandatory integrity level ("S-1-16-12288"); if that fails, it falls back to normal mode execution.

sshd_conf.dat creates three threads to perform keylogging, clipboard monitoring, and screen capturing.

Attribution and Correlation
The captured samples exhibit similarities to previous Kimsuky attack operations disclosed by us [1, 2].

The POST request format used by the samples to communicate with the C&C server is similar, with field names generated randomly.

The samples also determine whether to proceed with further actions based on the server's response.

In past Kimsuky attacks, a self-deletion script named %temp%\msbuild.bat was also used, and its content matches exactly.

The method used to establish persistence is the same, employing sc commands with similar formats.

On the other hand, the C&C URL for the backdoor IconCache.mdf is hxxp://gtfydu.surfnet.ca/index.php, using a dynamic domain. Around the time when gtfydu.surfnet.ca was active, the resolved IP address (104.37.184.39) was also associated with multiple Korean dynamic domains, which is a common pattern in Kimsuky’s historical attack infrastructure.

Other domains recently associated with the same IP:

auth.worksmobile.r-e.kr

secure.navdomain.n-e.kr

login.hiwork.o-r.kr

auth.linkedin.r-e.kr

The presence of keywords like "work" and "linkedin" in the domain names suggests that these dynamic domains might be used by attackers for phishing campaigns themed around employment or recruitment.

Conclusion
The malicious software discovered in this incident continues to exhibit characteristics typical of the Kimsuky group:

Droppers release signed legitimate files for camouflage.

Malicious files include random data to avoid a unique hash signature.

Use of regsvr32.exe to launch DLL samples.

Self-deletion under specific conditions.

Both backdoor samples use dynamic domains for C&C servers. The malware responsible for subsequent actions is fetched from the server and loaded directly into memory. The updated backdoor adds stealth by executing its core payload only on machines with specific hostnames, demonstrating the highly targeted nature of this attack. It is likely that the attackers gathered intelligence in advance to create the target screening list.
