Anubis Banking Trojan Strikes Amid Global Pandemic 360 Security Brain Exposes Malware Manufacturing Network  
The Anubis banking Trojan capable of directly stealing funds from accounts remains one of the most malicious malware types. Recently, 360 Security Brain exclusively released the "In-Depth Exposure of Anubis Mobile Banking Trojan" report, comprehensively disclosing the rapidly spreading Anubis banking Trojan targeting over 300 financial institutions globally and its hidden high-risk malware production websites. From January 2020 to present, 360 Security Brain has captured over 6,000 Anubis family samples disguised as phishing campaigns impersonating global financial institutions. The malware creation websites behind Anubis significantly lower the technical barrier for threat actors, posing severe risks. Unlike conventional malware proliferation, this Anubis campaign introduces dangerous DIY malware creation platforms. Analysis reveals two public Trojan-building websites sharing identical IP addresses but different interfaces, both enabling even novice attackers to create customized Anubis variants through configurable parameters. Leaked backend code further allows operators to establish complete Anubis infrastructure. The websites provide extensive icon libraries for disguising malware as Flash Player, system tools, cryptocurrency apps, image editors, or games. Custom icon upload functionality enhances deception diversity. Technical analysis shows one website uses decompiled smali code while another leverages original Anubis source code, confirming prior source code leaks exploited by threat actors. Code analysis exposes 26 high-risk functions including application activation, permission escalation, keylogging, dialog spoofing, contact harvesting, SMS spamming, location tracking, and anti-detection mechanisms. Notably, hardening code enables signature evasion to bypass antivirus solutions. The control panel source code contains phishing infrastructure targeting 300+ global financial institutions across Europe, Asia, and North America. Poland shows the highest concentration of phishing sites followed by Turkey and Germany. Since January 2020, Flash Player remains the most frequent camouflage (6,000+ samples detected). Emerging campaigns exploit COVID-19 themes through Bitbucket-hosted malicious apps, currently in testing phase but potentially targeting pandemic-stricken regions. As a banking Trojan family originating in 2016 with leaked backend code since 2019, Anubis combines sophisticated capabilities with low technical barriers. The emergence of these construction websites further democratizes financial malware threats. 360 Security Brain continues monitoring Anubis developments while advising users to: avoid untrusted links/downloads; verify app sources; obtain software exclusively from official stores; exercise caution with financial/COVID-related app permissions.
