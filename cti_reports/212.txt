SideWinder APT Group Targeted Attacks Against South Asian Countries Disclosed
From late 2017 to early 2019, Tencent Yujian Threat Intelligence Center discovered sustained targeted attacks by a suspected India-based APT group against military targets in Pakistan and other South Asian countries. Our long-term analysis shows the group's earliest activities date back to 2012. Based on technical similarities with the SideWinder organization mentioned in Kaspersky's Q1 2018 report (though without published technical details), we continue using the designation "SideWinder" (T-APT-04). Since our initial technical analysis in May 2018, we've observed continuous updates to their attack techniques to evade security solutions. The latest samples exploit CVE-2017-11882 to fetch HTA scripts from http://cdn-do.net/includes/b7199e61/-1/7340/dfd9a1da/final, executing PreBotHta.dll through RunHtmlApplication. This DLL checks for security products ("360","avast","avg"), reports non-listed AVs to http://cdn-do.net/plugins/-1/7340/true/true/, sets autostart entry "credw1", and deploys Duser.dll via credwiz.exe. Duser.dll downloads JS scripts from now-offline C2 servers. Attack vectors include malicious LNK files (e.g., executing mshta.exe with HTA URLs) and Office documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882. Loader techniques evolved through three phases: 1) PowerShell-based HTA scripts (pre-Oct 2018), 2) Direct initialization via HTA without PowerShell (Oct 2018-Feb 2019), 3) Embedded PreBotHta.dll for AV detection and payload delivery (post-Feb 2019). Final payloads use VB/C# RATs for information collection and keylogging, with infrastructure linking to Pakistani targets (e.g., NADRA-related domains). VT upload traces and decoy documents referencing "Rashid Memorial" (associated with Pakistani military) confirm targeting patterns. SideWinder demonstrates mature capabilities using Office exploits, HTA scripts, LOLBINs, and evolving VB malware, primarily targeting Pakistan but posing potential risks to Chinese entities due to geopolitical proximity.
