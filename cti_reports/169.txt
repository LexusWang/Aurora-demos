Operation Broken Shell Lazarus APT-C-26 Group Targeted Attacks Against Security Researchers Exposed
The Lazarus (APT-C-26) group is a North Korean APT organization that has long conducted infiltration attacks against South Korea, the United States, China, India and other countries. It also attacks global financial institutions and is considered the most significant threat to the global financial sector, with its earliest attack activities traceable to 2007. In recent years, Lazarus has shifted its focus from traditional financial industries to the cryptocurrency market, targeting global cryptocurrency organizations and related institutions. In 2020, while maintaining interest in financial sectors, the group launched new attacks against dozens of government agencies and major corporations worldwide. These attacks were dubbed "Dream Job" operations by security vendors due to their use of fake recruitment information from large companies as bait. Recently, Google's security team disclosed social engineering attacks against security researchers via Twitter and other social media platforms. Through analysis by 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute and network-wide telemetry from 360 Security Brain, we confirmed this incident as Lazarus (APT-C-26)'s first APT campaign targeting the cybersecurity industry, planned for over a year. The operation employed social engineering tactics similar to those used in cryptocurrency and corporate attacks, combined with malicious "PoC" source code packages observed in the attacks. We have named this campaign "Operation Broken Shell". The attack reconstruction shows Lazarus' pattern of developing industry-specific social engineering schemes, spending extended periods infiltrating professional communities while forging institutional identities and professional roles to gain trust. Key details of this security industry-targeted operation include: 1) Establishment of a technical blog (blog.br0vvnn[.]io) in October 2020; 2) Publication of multiple vulnerability analysis articles through the blog, reposted by cybersecurity media to enhance industry credibility; 3) Social media account preparation starting from August 2019, with four months spent building connections in security communities since September 2020; 4) Distribution of malicious PoC project files containing backdoors through technical exchanges, triggering payload installation during compilation. The group shared malicious PoC source packages containing malicious code in Visual Studio project configuration files. For example, the dxgkrnl_poc.vcxproj project inserted malicious commands in the PreBuildEvent field, executing hidden DLL payloads via PowerShell during compilation. The malicious DLL adds itself to the RUN registry for persistence, decrypts embedded data, and performs reflective loading when specific parameters (like lxUi5CZ0IV45j89Y) are detected. It subsequently downloads additional DLLs from remote servers. Analysis reveals multiple connections to Lazarus' previous operations. The samples share similarities with those from DreamJob campaigns (MD5: 35545d891ea9370dfef9a8a2ab1cf95d), including identical algorithms for generating user identifiers using rand logic, matching code structures for information collection, and overlapping compromised domains mentioned in Google's report. This meticulously planned operation demonstrates Lazarus' patience in preparing social media personas over years, publishing technical articles for credibility building, and ultimately delivering malicious PoC packages. Targeting security researchers could lead to corporate network infiltration and theft of critical vulnerability research. Organizations should remain vigilant against such industry-specific penetration attempts. 360's enterprise security products including Threat Intelligence Cloud, Sandbox Cloud, APT Panoramic Radar, and Security Guard Team Edition currently provide detection capabilities against Lazarus group attacks.
