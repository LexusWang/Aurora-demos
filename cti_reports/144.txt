Konni Group Suspected Attack Activities Targeting South Korean Enterprises  
1. Overview The Antiy CERT recently discovered attack activities by the APT group Konni. Based on lure document content and historical attack patterns, this campaign is suspected to target South Korean enterprises. The Konni APT group's activities can be traced back to 2014 and remain active, primarily targeting Russia and South Korea through spear-phishing attacks utilizing social热点 topics. Recent findings indicate Konni may deliver tax-related ZIP files to targets. When users open the LNK lure file within the ZIP, predefined PowerShell commands execute to display decoy documents, extract embedded ZIP contents, implement registry persistence mechanisms, collect basic information like file lists and process lists from victim machines, exfiltrate data, and ultimately download/execute subsequent payloads. 2. Konni Attack Analysis Table 2-1 ZIP File Original Filename: 소명자료 제출요청 안내.zip (Guidance on Submission Request for Explanatory Materials) MD5: 24949137f4a88bee8a11e0060a5eeb11 Size: 470.17 KB VT First Upload: 2023-06-29 08:14:39 UTC VT Detection: 21/61 The ZIP contains three LNK/HWP files: 소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk, 인지세 조사 보고서.hwp, 자금출처명세서.hwp. The LNK file (MD5:395b6399fea137783ffdac84f2d4c256) executes PowerShell code to decode hex-encoded data, revealing operations to: 1) Drop decoy document 2) Delete LNK file 3) Extract embedded ZIP to %public%\documents 4) Execute start.vbs. The decoy document displays tax-related HWP content while malicious scripts perform: - Persistence via registry RUN key - Data collection (file listings, process lists, systeminfo) - Encrypted exfiltration using 28499076.bat - Downloading subsequent CAB/ZIP payloads via 60937671.bat - DLL execution via rundll32.exe. 3. Attribution Analysis Decoy documents use Korean HWP format with tax-related themes, consistent with Konni's historical targets. Code structures show similarities with previous campaigns in script patterns (file retrieval, data collection, C2 communication), including overlapping code segments between current and historical samples (Figure 3-3/3-4). Infrastructure involves domains mimicking Naver services (naver.cloudfiles001.com, naver.drive001.com) and multiple bulletproof hosting providers. 4. ATT&CK Mapping The attack chain covers 15 techniques across 9 ATT&CK stages: Resource Development (Infrastructure Acquisition), Initial Access (Phishing), Execution (Scheduled Tasks/User Execution), Persistence (Registry Run Keys), Defense Evasion (Deobfuscation), Discovery (File/Process/System Enumeration), Collection (Data Compression/Staging), Command & Control (Application Layer Protocols), Exfiltration (Automated Exfiltration). 5. Conclusion Konni continues employing tax-themed lures in 2023, maintaining LNK file attack vectors while enhancing data encryption during transmission compared to earlier campaigns. 6.
