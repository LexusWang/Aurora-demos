Phishing Disinformation Showcase Official WeChat Zombie Follower Cleanup Campaign Emerges  
The phishing fraud scheme disguised as "free zombie follower cleanup" has resurfaced with new tactics, as 360 Security Brain recently detected a malicious software named "Official WeChat Zombie Follower Cleanup" actively deceiving unsuspecting users. Analysis reveals this phishing tool lures victims into authorizing login credentials through WeChat web/client interfaces, subsequently exploiting account access to conduct automated fraudulent activities including unauthorized friend additions, mass advertising dissemination, and fabricated loan requests. 360 Security Brain advises cautious identification of suspicious sources and recommends installing 360 Mobile Guard for privacy protection. The campaign employs sophisticated deception techniques, forging legitimate-looking webpage prompts such as "This page is provided by mp.weixin.qq.com" and counterfeit official complaint handling mechanisms. Malicious actors even fraudulently displayed "360 Website Security Certification" trust marks. Technical analysis outlines a three-stage attack chain: bait distribution via QR code-embedded promotional materials, elaborate webpage spoofing with geolocation tracking through Amap's API (key:6145fa3d371ec84a6a46e7eae849bcd2), and account takeover upon QR code confirmation. Attackers implemented psychological manipulation tactics including 60-second delay mechanisms to suppress login notifications and forged WeChat Security Center interfaces to neutralize user complaints. Compromised accounts automatically propagate phishing QR codes to all contacts without trace, enabling viral spread. 360's infrastructure analysis identified nearly 200 registered phishing domains associated with this campaign, including operational IP 47.113.201[.]90 and API endpoints like vwl5djcoks72[.]cn/api/front/qrloginurl.
