North Korean Lazarus APT Steals Credit Card Data from US and EU Retailers  
The North Korea-linked Lazarus APT group has been stealing payment card information from customers of large US and European retailers for at least a year, according to Sansec researchers. The threat actors compromise legitimate websites using e-skimming techniques to exfiltrate stolen credit card data. Previously targeting banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, experts estimate the group's operations have generated $2 billion. Lazarus Group activities surged in 2014-2015, primarily using custom malware considered highly sophisticated by investigators. Active since at least 2009 (possibly 2007), the group engages in cyber espionage and destructive operations. During investigations of e-skimming attacks, researchers observed malicious code loading domains connected to spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Lazarus APT. The attacks share identical codebases, with victims including Claire's, Focus Camera, CBD Armor, Microbattery, and Truechess. Attackers hijacked websites like Lux Model Agency (Italy), a Tehran vintage music store, and a New Jersey bookstore to conduct skimming operations. COBRA malware developers created a global infiltration network using compromised legitimate sites to funnel stolen assets for sale on dark web markets. North Korean hackers register domain names resembling victim stores to avoid detection, a common Magecart-style tactic. Sansec linked infiltration domains including stefanoturco.com (2019-07-19 to 2019-08-10), technokain.com (2019-07-06 to 2019-07-09), and luxmodelagency.com (2019-06-23 to 2020-04-07) to Pyongyang. Malware sometimes disappeared for 24 hours before reappearing with redirected data exfiltration. While alternative threat actors cannot be fully excluded, Sansec asserts multiple independent links to previous North Korean operations and attributes large-scale digital skimming campaigns to state-sponsored actors since May 2019.
