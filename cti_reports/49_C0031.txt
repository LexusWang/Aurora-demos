During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers discovered and exploited default credentials found on many Unitronics Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Human-Machine Interface (HMI). For many of these devices, the default password was set to ‘1111’.[1]During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers defaced controllers’ Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which prevented multiple entities from being able to operate their devices normally.[1][4][5][2] Additionally, the CyberAv3ngers caused a communications failure in a remote pumping station.During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers exploited devices connected to the public internet, such as internet connected Unitronics Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with Human-Machine Interface (HMI) and networking equipment such as cellular modems found in OT environments.[1]During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers caused multiple businesses to halt operations due to the unavailability of the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Human-Machine Interface (HMI). These victims covered multiple sectors.During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers caused multiple businesses to halt operations in their industrial environments, impacting their typical business operations. These victims covered multiple sectors.During the Unitronics Defacement Campaign, the CyberAv3ngers replaced the existing graphic on the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with their own, thereby preventing PLC owners and operators from viewing PLC information on the HMI.[1]
