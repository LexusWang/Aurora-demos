Overview
In May 2022, Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center published the article "Operation Dragon Breath (APT-Q-27): Dimensionality Reduction Strike Against the Gambling Industry," which disclosed the attacks by GoldenEyeDog (Qi An Xin internal tracking number APT-Q-27) targeting the gambling industry. The article introduced the Miuuti Group—an attack group targeting the gambling sector with a complex and highly mobile personnel composition, possibly overlapping with known organizations. Since 2015, they have exploited multiple communication software 0-day vulnerabilities. Another article, "Operation Dragon Dance: The Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Gambling Industry," discussed two 0-day vulnerabilities used by GoldenEyeDog and provided a full attack case analysis.

GoldenEyeDog’s operations cover remote control, cryptocurrency mining, DDoS, and traffic-related activities. Based on Qi An Xin Threat Radar mapping and analysis, since 2022, GoldenEyeDog has been one of the highest-frequency domestic attacking groups. This article introduces the recently captured GoldenEyeDog samples and attack methods, and discusses their common tactics and sample evolution.

Attack Methods
The GoldenEyeDog group has repeatedly used watering hole websites hosting malicious software installers to implant trojans on victims' devices. Their malware has been developed in languages including .NET, C++, Go, and Delphi, with overall high evasion capabilities.

GoldenEyeDog deploys fake software download websites and uses various tactics to lure victims into downloading and installing malicious programs. Their main targets are the gambling industry and related personnel. Because these fake sites employ SEO optimization and are very convincing, anyone searching for specific counterfeit software risks downloading disguised malicious installers. Thus, GoldenEyeDog’s attack surface is very broad, affecting domestic targets across internet companies, securities, manufacturing, IT, and other industries. Recently, GoldenEyeDog has increasingly used emerging remote control trojans such as SilverFox and winos for their remote control operations.

The GoldenEyeDog attack flow is illustrated below:

Commonly counterfeited popular software by the group includes:
Telegram Chinese version installer
KuaiLian VPN
Potato social software
WPS Office software
Sogou Input Method
Opera browser
Chrome browser
Tor
i4 Assistant
Team Viewer
ToDesk
ChuanSuo VPN
KuaiFan VPN
FeiLian VPN
v2rayN
AiJiaSu acceleration
TradingView investment software
XuanFeng Converter, etc.
Simultaneously, the group targeted cryptocurrency practitioners by deploying counterfeit websites for multiple virtual currency trading platforms, including MEXC, OKX, and Gate.io.

Besides directly obtaining malicious programs from watering hole website directories, it was also discovered that multiple watering holes shared malicious domains as common servers. Attackers distinguish corresponding malware via program names or irregular codes. Once the malicious server recognizes different codes, it redirects to corresponding cloud storage server links for download.
Propagation Methods
Search Engine SEO
GoldenEyeDog optimizes watering hole pages using Yoast SEO to improve search engine rankings and lure victims into downloading malicious installers. Many of their watering holes rank highly in search results; for example, their WPS watering hole site ranks second on Google.

Gambling Sites Hosting Defacement Pages or Ads
The group was also found to embed watering hole site links on multiple gambling websites.

Distribution via Q&A platforms, forums, and other channels

Sample Analysis
The following analyzes several representative samples related to this incident.

Telegram Chinese Version
Sample Source
This sample comes from the watering hole site www.telegramkx.com and matches the trojan operation flow previously seen from GoldenEyeDog:

Basic Information

Filename	File Size	File MD5
TG_Z_HB_TELE_DESKTOP	77,273,108 bytes	27889662C62E84E3D4400B372379C1C9

The trojan masquerades as the Chinese version of Telegram installer:

Trojan Execution Details

This sample is an EXE installer package generated by Setup Factory Runtime. At runtime, it releases a signed Chinese Telegram program, with signature info as follows:

It also creates a malicious EXE disguised as a flash component running in the background:

lpxs.exe primarily decrypts a malicious DLL and executes it. Its decryption algorithm is similar to those used by GoldenEyeDog’s previous trojans:

After decryption, it calls exported functions of the malicious DLL:

The HDPX exported function includes anti-debugging measures, mainly creating script files and invoking them, while dropping both white and black trojans plus an encrypted TXT file:

The BAT script disables UAC prompts by modifying the registry:

Subsequently, the trojan decrypts the TXT file to release a modified Gh0st trojan with C2 = 154.19.167.161:15628:

i4 Assistant
Sample Source
This sample originates from the watering hole site i4.com.vn. Analysis shows it belongs to the SilverFox trojan family and ultimately releases Gh0st for remote control:

Basic Information

Filename	File Size	File MD5
i4Tools8_v8.29_Setup	273,814,143 bytes	FBA8EBBFB1D526736498650DA0656AA9

This trojan masquerades as the i4 Assistant installer, packaged using Inno Setup:

Trojan Execution Details

This sample will drop the legitimate iTools installer, as well as release white + black trojan programs:

The white utility is related to a certain company's "Printer Guard" files:

The black DLL detects a debugger and exits immediately without triggering malicious behavior:

It decrypts its hardcoded shellcode and parameters via XOR, then calls ZwCreateThreadEx to perform process injection:

The shellcode XOR decrypts the passed binary data to obtain the DLL and calls its exported functions:

This DLL’s main functions are anti-debugging and monitoring 360 Security Guard. After monitoring, it releases the next stage white + black programs and a shellcode file with a .dat extension. During this process, the trojan first drops the programs into the Windows temporary directory, then uses CMD commands through a pipe to rename and move them to the root directory of the C drive:

The next stage DLL program first adds the directories 'C:\Program Files (x86)' and 'C:' to the exclusion list of Windows Defender:

It creates a mutex named "FakeMutex":

Finally, similar to the previous trojan phase, it injects shellcode from the .dat file:

The shellcode decrypts a UPX-packed DLL file in memory and calls its exported functions. This is a modified Gh0st trojan, with C2 = 38.46.12.82:51163:

Clash
Sample Source

This sample is related to the watering hole website v2raynos.com, analyzed as a SilverFox family trojan, which ultimately releases Winos for remote control:

Basic Information

Filename | File Size | File MD5
Clash.for.Windows.Setup | 189,645,312 bytes | 617CD6206A0745CD6AAE92B09F8B4C2A

This trojan disguises itself as the MSI installer package for Clash:

Trojan Execution Details

During installation, this sample drops a black DLL and a malicious file with a .log extension:

It releases the next stage PE file through the .log and calls its malicious exported functions, dropping multiple .lnk files. The first .lnk adds the second dick.lnk to the registry for autostart, and the dick.lnk file then launches its white + black programs:

The white + black programs release the Winos trojan through a second Ensup.log. The sample’s embedded configuration information is as follows:

C2 = 202.146.220.95:6666/ 202.146.220.95:8888/ 202.146.220.95:8080

Mining Activity
Besides deploying remote control trojans, the Golden Eye Dog group also has mining-related trojan programs. Sample information is as follows:

Filename | File Size | File MD5
IBusEnum | 5,120,852 bytes | 42A802F20D8998F19CE8ED5F84A9CD2A

Analysis confirms this sample is an XMRig mining trojan, which comes with a configuration file and supports remote configuration updates via a hardcoded URL: "http://cdn-down.cdndown.shop/config.json".

Embedded configuration information is as follows:

Current remote configuration information is as follows:

Summary
Combining the attack targets mentioned in our previous analysis reports and the counterfeit sites forged by Golden Eye Dog, it is evident that their main targets remain industries related to gambling and fraud. However, due to the wide user distribution of the various popular software they impersonate, victims from other industries inevitably also appear.

In fact, through Qi An Xin Threat Radar telemetry and the Qi An Xin Red Droplet team’s APT attack clues based on customer onsite investigations, combined with alert data from the full range of Qi An Xin threat intelligence products, Golden Eye Dog has consistently been one of the highest frequency attackers domestically since 2022, involving multiple sectors such as education, internet, securities, manufacturing, and IT software services.

Currently, the full line of products based on Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center data, including Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, Qi An Xin NGSOC, and Qi An Xin Situational Awareness, all support precise detection of these types of attacks.
