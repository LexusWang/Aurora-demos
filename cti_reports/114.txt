Disclosure of Recent Large-Scale Phishing Campaigns by Poison Ivy APT-C-01 Group  
The Poison Ivy (APT-C-01) group is an APT organization that has long conducted cyber espionage against critical domestic institutions in defense, government, technology, and education sectors, with traceable activities dating back to 2007. In a report titled "Revealing Poison Ivy (APT-C-01) Group's Targeted Attacks Against Chinese Critical Institutions in the First Half of 2020" exclusively released by 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute on October 11, the group's frequent cyber espionage activities exploiting COVID-19 hotspots against domestic defense and government entities were disclosed. Recent attacks by Poison Ivy have intensified rather than subsided. In June 2020, the group adjusted its tactics to focus on single high-value targets. Since early August, we observed large-scale credential-phishing campaigns targeting domestic universities and research institutes, involving numerous organizations, with ongoing active attacks. Attackers employed spear-phishing emails containing malicious links, consistent with their historical tactics but with expanded targeting and increased frequency. Socially engineered emails impersonated work documents relevant to victims' roles to lure them into accessing phishing sites for credential theft. Fake login interfaces mimicking QQ Mail and NetEase Mail prompted victims to enter credentials before allowing document downloads. The group created phishing pages mimicking university email systems, including forged login portals for multiple institutions. Decoy documents were tailored to targets' professional duties, using filenames such as "****** Notification Letter," "National ****** Survey Questionnaire," and "Ministry of Science and Technology ****** Project Application.docx." C2 infrastructure analysis revealed overlaps with historical campaigns: some domains used the same dynamic DNS provider (e.g., serveusers.com) as 2018 operations, while others reused exposed C2s like 141.164.*.* for both phishing and malware distribution. WHOIS data leaks from registered phishing domains inadvertently exposed attackers' geographical locations.
