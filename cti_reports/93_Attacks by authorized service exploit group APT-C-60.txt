JPCERT/CC confirmed an attack targeting a domestic organization around August 2024, believed to be conducted by the APT-C-60 group. This attack involved sending emails impersonating job applicants to the organization’s recruitment contact, infecting the recipient with malware. This article explains the attack techniques in the following sections:

Initial intrusion flow
This attack started with a spear-phishing email that contained a Google Drive link. Accessing the Google Drive link triggered the download of a VHDX file containing malware. VHDX is a virtual disk file format that can be mounted to view the contained files. The VHDX file used in this attack included LNK files and decoy documents as shown in Figure 2.

Contents of Self-Introduction.lnk
Furthermore, IPML.txt opens the decoy document and creates the downloader SecureBootUEFI.dat, achieving persistence (Figure 4). Persistence is implemented by COM hijacking, registering the path of SecureBootUEFI.dat with the COM interface ID F82B4EF1-93A9-4DDE-8015-F7950A1A6E31.

Downloader analysis

Downloader operation overview
SecureBootUEFI.dat accesses legitimate services Bitbucket and StatCounter. StatCounter is first accessed and used by the attacker to verify infected machines. After confirmation, the downloader is uploaded to Bitbucket. The infected machine sends unique information in the referrer to StatCounter (Figure 6), allowing the attacker to identify each infected device. The referrer contains an encoded string created by concatenating the computer name and home directory, and computer name and user name, removing non-alphabetic characters, then encoding with XOR 3.
SecureBootUEFI.dat then accesses Bitbucket with the encoded string in the URL path, downloads Service.dat, decodes it with XOR key g73qrc4dwx8jt9qmhi4s, saves it to %Userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Service.dat, and executes it.
Communication flow of SecureBootUEFI.dat
Next, Service.dat downloads two samples from a different Bitbucket repository: cbmp.txt and icon.txt. These are decoded using Base64 and XOR key AadDDRTaSPtyAG57er#$ad!lDKTOPLTEL78pE, saved as cn.dat and sp.dat respectively in %userprofile%\appdata\local\Microsoft\windows\fonts.
Then, cn.dat is persisted via COM hijacking using COM interface ID 7849596a-48ea-486e-8937-a2a3009f31a9 (Figure 7).

Finally, cn.dat executes sp.dat.

Backdoor analysis
The backdoor used in this attack is called SpyGrace by ESET.[1] The configuration within the backdoor includes version information; the sample analyzed was version v3.1.6. SpyGrace v3.0 has been reported by ThreatBook CTI,[2] and its command types, RC4 and AES keys match those found in this sample. The backdoor’s initialization phase executes the following:
Configuration initialization
Mutex creation (905QD4656:H)
Network connectivity check (to api.ipfy.org)
Execution of .exe, .dat, .db, .ext files under %appdata%\Microsoft\Vault\UserProfileRoaming
Some initialization steps are performed using the CRT initterm function, which runs before the DllMain function.

Backdoor commands and C2 URLs are listed in Appendix A.
Campaigns using similar malware
From August to September 2024, security vendors have reported campaigns using malware similar to the samples described here.[1][3] These campaigns share common features such as abusing legitimate services like Bitbucket and StatCounter and persistence via COM hijacking.

Decoy documents found in the recycle bin folder of the VHDX file suggest similar attacks occurred in East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and China, matching targeted countries reported in other reports.

Conclusion
This attack abuses legitimate services like Bitbucket and StatCounter and targets East Asia including Japan, thus requiring caution. The samples and communication endpoints used in this attack can be found in the Appendix.
