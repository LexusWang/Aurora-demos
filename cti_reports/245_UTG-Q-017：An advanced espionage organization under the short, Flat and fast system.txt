Overview
The term “short, fast, and quick” in the financial investment field usually refers to short-term, low-risk, and quick-return investments. Applied to the cyberattack domain, it describes no-file shellcode residing in system processes for a short time, smooth exploitation with low detection probability, and rapid exfiltration of stolen files to attackers. Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center’s Red Raindrop team discovered an overseas advanced espionage group perfectly fitting these criteria and named it UTG-Q-017, which has affected numerous government and enterprise targets.

UTG-Q-017 first became active in August 2024, intermittently delivering Chrome Nday exploit links via high-traffic global advertising JS. Their tactics and techniques include:

Fileless operation throughout: Using a Chrome Nday attack chain to inject first-stage downloader shellcode into system memory, eventually loading the lumma stealer espionage Trojan in memory, which steals files and then retreats.

One-time C2 infrastructure: UTG-Q-017 uses brand-new C2 servers and domains for each campaign. The downloader shellcode has unique characteristics linked solely to this group. Within less than a year of activity, we captured nearly 500 downloader shellcode IPs and about 1,600 corresponding domains. Including domains embedded in lumma stealer, total domains may reach five to six thousand. The attackers invested significant financial resources in this “short, fast, and quick” attack chain.

Short control duration: The window for exploiting Chrome via ads is only 1–2 days, with activities at least weekly. Besides being fully fileless, the malicious code does not seek long-term persistence. From Chrome exploit trigger to lumma stealer data theft takes just 3–5 minutes, with no visible impact.

Detection and defense: Over the past year, Tianqing’s “Liuhe” advanced threat defense engine detected over a hundred UTG-Q-017 C2s—about a quarter of their total C2 infrastructure. Although not the only affected region, China is a major hotspot. We recommend government clients enable cloud detection to discover unknown threats. The “Liuhe” engine can now intercept shellcode in memory.

Infection Chain
The fileless attack chain is as follows:

We analyzed ads JS on fake, adult, and legitimate websites, noting many high-traffic ad domains. Configuration details include:

Observed the phrase “ads by ClickAdilla,” a foreign ad delivery service provider.

Also observed sentry ad links with account identifier 2eb59608a84d354e409ffc15596042c6, possibly registered by the attacker.

We did not trace back which ad interface pushed the exploit JS, but related domains see at least millions of accesses in China alone, covering everyday web browsing.

We speculate the attackers bypassed ad platform detection, causing the platform to deliver UTG-Q-017’s captcha.js script disguised as a captcha. This triggered the Nday exploit, with the time window for exploit delivery only 1–2 days, making tracing and attribution difficult.

Targets
An interesting observation from victim statistics: all infected endpoints run Chrome version 109.0.5414.120 on Windows 7 SP1 (6.1.7601.XXX.1.1). This Chrome version is the last Chrome kernel adapted for Win7, which stopped updates in early 2023. In other words, UTG-Q-017, newly active mid-2024, heavily invested in a “short, fast, and quick” attack chain designed specifically for a platform no longer updated since early 2023. This may seem like “going backward,” but considering the attacker’s understanding of “national conditions,” it makes sense. Results show only government and enterprise terminals are controlled, and the data stolen justifies the high investment in infrastructure. The victim industry distribution is as follows:

Memory-Resident Shellcode
The injected downloader shellcode in system processes is only 1 KB in size and unique to UTG-Q-017. Functionally, it splits into two types: injection and loader. Loader functions include:

Fetching and executing second-stage shellcode from a remote server. The C2 server may verify victims, making direct dynamic debugging and retrieval of the second-stage shellcode difficult. Injection-type adds process creation and injection on top of loader functions.

The second-stage shellcode uses a 32-bit “Heaven’s Gate” shellcode to call 64-bit APIs during loading. Tianqing’s “Liuhe” engine detected only a small number of lumma stealer instances in memory, so UTG-Q-017 might also load other unknown backdoors.

Lumma stealer is an espionage tool based on the Maas framework, with C2 domains generally hosted on Cloudflare CDN. It steals critical data such as browser cookies, email credentials, sensitive files, and various client credentials[1]. After data theft, the attack cycle ends with no persistence or other sensitive operations.

Summary
Currently, all products based on Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center’s data—including the Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, Qi An Xin NGSOC, and Qi An Xin Situational Awareness—support precise detection of this type of attack.
