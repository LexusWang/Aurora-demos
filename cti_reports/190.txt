Poisonous Vine APT-C-01 Military and Political Intelligence Espionage Group Exposed  
Chapter 1 Overview 1. Key Findings Since 2007, the 360 Advanced Threat Response Team has discovered that the Poisonous Vine group (APT-C-01) conducted cyber espionage activities against key Chinese defense, government, technology, education, and maritime institutions for 11 years. The group primarily focuses on military industry, Sino-US relations, cross-strait relations, and maritime-related fields, sharing similar target sectors with the previously disclosed OceanLotus APT group. The first Poisonous Vine Trojan was captured in December 2007. Over 11 years, we obtained 13 malware variants across 73 samples. Initial attacks employed spear-phishing emails with carefully crafted lures using industry-specific content like conference materials or research reports. Ten exploit documents were identified including one 0day vulnerability. Infections spread across 31 Chinese provinces with 59 C&C domains across four regions. Notable timeline: December 2007: First Trojan targeting maritime sector; March 2008: Attack on university lab; February 2009: Military industry targeting began; October 2009: Anti-scanning technique (reverse-ordered API strings) implemented; December 2011: Anti-dynamic detection (incorrect API parameters) added; February 2012: Modified zxshell backdoor for document theft; March 2013: Concentrated attacks on CAS and ministries; October 2013: Watering hole attack on government site; May 2014: Enhanced zxshell variant with military-related keyword search; September 2014: CVE-2014-4114 0day exploitation; October 2014: iSIGHT report and Microsoft patch release; February 2015: Attacks on defense associations using Kanbox samples; October 2017: CVE-2017-8759 exploitation against media; April 2018: 360 disclosure of CVE-2017-8759 attacks; May 2018: Maritime sector campaigns. 2. Naming Convention Named "Poisonous Vine" (APT-C-01) based on Poison Ivy RAT usage and cloud storage exfiltration patterns resembling vine growth. Corresponds to Green Spot (An Tian Lab's designation) through vendor consensus. Chapter 2 Objectives and Victim Analysis 1. Targets Focused on stealing documents containing keywords: "military", "Taiwan", "report", etc. (34 keywords listed) and extensions: doc, ppt, xls, etc. Collected system info: MAC addresses, processes, disk info. 2. Industries Defense, government, technology, education, maritime affairs. 3. Geographical Spread Infections across 31 provinces with coastal concentration. Chapter 3 11-Year Campaign 1. Initial Vectors Spear-phishing with exploit docs (CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-6352, CVE-2017-8759), RLO extension spoofing, icon masking. Used PHPMailer and webmail for distribution. 2. Exploit Analysis Detailed technical breakdown of CVE-2012-0158 (MHT evasion), CVE-2014-6352 (0day UAC bypass), and CVE-2017-8759 (HTA->PowerShell chain). 3. RAT Evolution 11 variants including Poison Ivy (shellcode versions), modified zxshell (document theft), Kanbox cloud-based exfiltration, and custom RATs. Anti-analysis techniques: API string reversal (2009-2018), false API parameters (2011-2018), exception-based execution. 4. C&C Infrastructure Dynamic DNS providers (ChangeIP), Kanbox API abuse, blog platforms for payload hosting. IPs traced to US, Europe, and Southeast Asian ASNs. Chapter 4 Attribution 1. Operational Patterns Traditional Chinese font usage in decoy docs, BIG5 encoding in samples, Taiwan-related lures ("Cross-Strait Relations Research"), domain WHOIS info suggesting Taiwanese registration. Chapter 5 Capability Assessment Multi-stage payload delivery, cloud integration, sustained tooling development, regional political focus.
