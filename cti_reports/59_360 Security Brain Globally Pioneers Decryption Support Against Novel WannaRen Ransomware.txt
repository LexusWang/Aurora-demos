360 Security Brain Globally Pioneers Decryption Support Against Novel WannaRen Ransomware  
Recently, the trending topic #WannaRenVirusLargeScaleSpreading# has sparked widespread discussion. While public confusion persists regarding the origin and attack methods of this new ransomware, 360 Security Brain exclusively traced the perpetrator to the "Shadow Hidden" hacker group, becoming the first to analyze the ransomware's attack code and expose WannaRen's true nature. a5wzm-5sn8u Currently, 360 Security Brain has achieved global pioneering decryption support for WannaRen ransomware, with immediate updates deployed to the 360 Decryption Master. Affected individual and enterprise users can now recover encrypted files through one-click decryption via this tool. Notably bearing resemblance to WannaCry, the novel WannaRen ransomware suddenly struck global networks. During file encryption, it modifies file extensions to ".WannaRen" while the Shadow Hidden group leaves three randomly selected ransom notes: 【@WannaRen@.exe】, 【想解密请看此文本.txt】, and 【想解密请看此文本.gif】, demanding 0.05 BTC (approximately ¥2,580) as ransom. 360 Security Brain analysis reveals that WannaRen shares striking similarities with the globally devastating WannaCry virus—both exploit EternalBlue vulnerability for propagation, while their ransomware interfaces and file structures exhibit nearly identical layouts. aotzf-7v502 According to 360 Security Brain's溯源 analysis data, WannaRen can encrypt virtually all Windows file types, primarily impacting Windows 7 and Windows 10 systems. More alarmingly, its downloader contains an EternalBlue propagation module enabling lateral movement within networks. This means any infected device in an intranet environment could potentially compromise other EternalBlue-unpatched computers, posing critical threats to enterprise cybersecurity. Exposing Shadow Hidden as WannaRen's mastermind, 360 Security Brain leads global decryption efforts. As #WannaRenVirusLargeScaleSpreading# trended online, 360 Security Brain promptly identified the Shadow Hidden group. Investigation reveals that WannaRen's resemblance to WannaCry stems from Shadow Hidden's long-term exploitation of EternalBlue vulnerabilities to implant cryptocurrency miners (targeting PASC and Monero) for profit. acdt5-oa74h akw5s-kvc0v This ransomware campaign represents an evolution of Shadow Hidden's previous cryptomining attacks. Empowered by 360 Security Brain's capabilities, the 360 Decryption Master—the world's largest and most effective ransomware decryption tool supporting over 300 ransomware variants—has now become the first global solution to decrypt WannaRen. Affected users can utilize this tool for one-click file recovery. a1zh0-c3tvz
