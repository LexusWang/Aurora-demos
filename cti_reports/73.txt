APT-C-56 Transparent Tribe Recent Attack Analysis and Correlated Suspected Gorgon Group Attack Incident Alert
Transparent Tribe (alias APT36, ProjectM, C-Major), a South Asia-linked APT group, has long conducted targeted attacks against political and military entities in neighboring countries and regions (especially India). The group developed its proprietary CrimsonRAT malware and has been observed spreading USB worms. Transparent Tribe previously mimicked Donot's malicious document macros showing high similarity, and also replicated SideWinder Group's attack patterns. It persistently targets Indian government agencies, public sectors, and various industries including healthcare, power, finance, and manufacturing for cyber espionage. Recently, 360 Advanced Threat Research Center discovered and captured Transparent Tribe's malicious documents attacking India, ultimately deploying CrimsonRAT. Concurrently, we monitored suspected Gorgon Group attacks using Netwire against India. This Pakistan-linked group has conducted targeted attacks against UK, Spain, Russia, and US entities. Gorgon has been suspected of connections with Transparent Tribe and potential involvement in Aggah campaigns. I. Recent Transparent Tribe Attack Analysis The captured malicious document triggers macro execution upon opening, disguising as HDM Media-related programs under ALLUSERSPROFILE directory. APT36 employs string concatenation techniques to split "exe" characters evading static detection. The payload releases a .NET Dropper checking for zip files in Templates directory, manipulating resource section data. It verifies .ford suffix files before proceeding with RAT deployment in ProgramData directory based on OS versions. The final payload CrimsonRAT implements multiple commands including process enumeration (getavs), file upload (thumb), persistence (putsrt), screen capture (scrsz), and file operations (dowf/delt). II. Correlated Shoot Operation Analysis We captured Indian-targeted samples delivering NetwireRAT, commercial RAT software adopted by APT33 and Gorgon Group. The malicious download link hxxp://lms.apsdigicamp[.]com/webapps/uploads/acc/cctv-footages/student-termination-and-proof.zip potentially compromises the Indian Army Public School website. The archive contains pornographic images, malicious documents, and PE files. The decoy document displays fake password protection luring users to enable macros, subsequently downloading Adobe.exe from C2. The Dropper disguised as Adobe PDF uses student-cctv-video(private) filenames, displaying fake error dialogs while performing AMSI bypass via AmsiScanBuffer modification, registry persistence, and process hollowing. The final NetwireRAT payload enables remote control capabilities. Conclusion The India-Pakistan conflict involving border, cultural, and historical issues drives continuous cyber espionage activities. Indian groups like Donot (APT-C-35) target Pakistani military entities, while Pakistan-linked Transparent Tribe reciprocates attacks. This geopolitical rivalry underscores the critical role of cybersecurity capabilities in national security intelligence operations.
