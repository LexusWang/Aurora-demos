Avaddon Ransomware Emerges With Million-Scale Botnet in Global Rampage
While ransomware threats remain frequent, 2020 witnesses an influx of new variants. Recently, 360 Security Brain became the first in China to detect the novel Avaddon ransomware spreading globally via Phorpiex botnet, demanding $500 in Bitcoin after encrypting victims' files. According to 360 Security Brain's monitoring data, this ransomware commenced propagation on June 4 with peak activity on June 5, showing resurgence after temporary decline. However, users are protected by 360 Security Guard's capabilities empowered by 360 Security Brain to intercept and eliminate Avaddon threats. The ransomware's rapid proliferation leverages Phorpiex botnet's worm-like characteristics that infected over 1 million Windows devices through removable drives, spam emails, credential brute-forcing, exploit kits, and malicious installations. 360's analysis further reveals Avaddon's dark web monetization via RaaS model, achieving in-the-wild propagation within one day after its June 3 underground market release. Employing hybrid RSA+AES encryption, Avaddon scans local disks, mounts unmounted devices, and encrypts network drives while evading recovery through shadow copy deletion, automatic repair disabling, and Recycle Bin purging. It modifies encrypted files with .advn extension while sparing specific formats like .exe and .dll. Notably resembling GandCrab in propagation methods, payment portals, and $500 ransom pattern, Avaddon also strategically avoids Russian-speaking regions. Although formidable, 360 Security Guard effectively blocks this threat. 360 Security Brain recommends: 1) Install 360 Security Guard from weishi.360.cn; 2) Implement access controls and regular backups for critical shared folders; 3) Regularly patch system and software vulnerabilities.
