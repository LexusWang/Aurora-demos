Naikon APT Group Analysis  
Check Point has discovered that the Naikon APT group is conducting cyberattacks against Asia-Pacific (APAC) national governments using a new backdoor named Aria-body to control victim networks. This report details the tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs), and infrastructure used by the Naikon APT group over the past five years. The Naikon APT has consistently targeted the same region over the past decade, including Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, and Brunei, employing the Aria-body backdoor. Targeted entities include ministries of foreign affairs, science and technology departments, and government-owned sectors. Attackers leverage compromised government organizations to infect other targets, exploiting trusted contacts to infiltrate new organizations and expand their network. The group aims to gather intelligence and monitor government activities by extracting specific documents from infected computers and networks, collecting data from removable drives, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes. Infected internal servers are repurposed as command-and-control (C&C) servers to evade detection. Multiple infection chains were observed for Aria-body distribution. Initial attacks involved malicious emails titled "The Indians Way.doc" sent from APAC government embassies to Australian state governments, containing RoyalRoad malware that attempted to download the next-stage payload from spool.jtjewifyn[.]com. Infection methods include: 1) RTF files exploiting RoyalRoad vulnerabilities; 2) archive files containing legitimate executables and malicious DLLs leveraging Outlook and Avast proxies; 3) direct execution via loader executables. Recent campaigns reused IP addresses across multiple domains for C&C infrastructure. The Aria-body loader, unchanged in core functionality since 2017, establishes persistence via startup folders or registry entries, injects into processes like rundll32.exe, decrypts configuration blobs, employs domain generation algorithms (DGA), communicates with C&C servers, and decrypts payloads. The loader configuration contains encrypted C&C domains, ports, user agents, and DGA seeds. DGA-generated domains are calculated based on seeds and communication dates. The Aria-body RAT (32/64-bit) features file manipulation, screenshots, process enumeration, OS data collection, and geolocation verification via checkip.amazonaws[.]com. Variants include USB data extraction, keylogging, reverse proxy, and modular expansion capabilities. Initialization involves creating structures for HTTP/TCP connections, followed by data collection (hostname, username, MachineGuid, public IP). Communication with C&C servers uses HTTP/TCP protocols, with XOR-encrypted data. A unique variant (outllib.dll) in Office.rar contains hardcoded C&C domains: blog.toptogear[.]com and 202.90.141[.]25. Attribution links include debug string overlaps with XsFunction backdoor, shared djb2 hash algorithms (XS02/AzManager), code similarities with legacy XsFunction components, and infrastructure overlaps with mopo3[.]net and myanmartech.vicp[.]net domains. Naikon APT remains active, utilizing RoyalRoad RTF exploit tools, custom Aria-body backdoors, evolving loaders, fileless techniques, and rotating infrastructure to evade detection.
