Analysis of X Elephant Group Phishing Attack Targeting Chinese Research Institutions  
1. Overview In the second half of 2023, Antiy CERT detected phishing emails from overseas APT groups impersonating China's "Vision Action" official organization targeting research institutions. The emails contained ZIP attachments with trojanized executables disguised as application clients through filename/icon camouflage and legitimate file bundling. Upon execution, the malware connected to attacker-controlled servers to download payloads, ultimately establishing reverse shell connections via backdoors for remote control. Based on code analysis and intelligence correlation, Antiy CERT attributes this activity to a South Asian country-affiliated threat actor temporarily designated as "X Elephant" pending further attribution evidence. 2. Attack Activity Analysis 2.1 Attack Chain The attacker sent spear-phishing emails impersonating "Vision Action" officials, delivering a first-stage downloader disguised as application software. This downloader simultaneously executed legitimate software to maintain disguise and fetched a second-stage downloader. The secondary downloader decrypted C2 URLs to retrieve the final backdoor implementing basic reverse shell functionality, as illustrated in Figure 2-1. 2.2 Phishing Email Analysis The email (Figure 2-2) used sender address info@*.*.com mimicking official domains, registered on 2023-07-11. The subject "Notification on Latest Version of Vision Action Application Client" targeted academic recipients with social engineering content about "client version upgrades," containing grammatical errors suggesting machine translation. The attachment "Vision Action Application Client 2.0.zip" contained the malicious executable. 2.3 Initial Payload Analysis The 301KB x64 executable (Table 2-1) employed XOR-based string obfuscation to hide C2 addresses. Sub_140001FB0 decrypted two URLs: https://94.198.*.*/tool/app/exe/ver/2.0/iexplorer.exe and https://94.198.*.*/tool/app/exe/abcd.exe via multi-layer XOR operations (Figures 2-3 to 2-9), using URLDownloadToFileW for payload retrieval. 2.4 Decoy Program Analysis The malware bundled legitimate Vision Action installation wizard (Figure 2-10) to maintain legitimacy. 2.5 Downloader Analysis The 107KB secondary downloader (Table 2-2) used character-wise subtraction (ASCII-2) to decrypt inverted C2 URLs, downloading msedges.exe backdoor to temp directories. 2.6 Backdoor Analysis The 1.29MB backdoor (Table 2-3) established TCP/443 connections to 46.249.*.*, implementing command control via pipe execution with five operation codes: 0 (execute cmd commands), 1 (change directory), 2 (exit), 5 (restart after 10s), and 6 (restart after 5s) (Figures 2-11 to 2-16). 3. Attack Objectives Targeting China's military-civil fusion initiative "Vision Action," the attackers aimed to compromise researchers' systems for intellectual property theft and lateral movement. Successful compromises enable full host control, credential harvesting, and trust chain exploitation. 4. ATT&CK Mapping The campaign involved 10 techniques across 8 ATT&CK stages (Table 4-1, Figure 4-1), including Reconnaissance (TA0043), Resource Development (TA0042), Initial Access (T1566), Execution (T1204), Defense Evasion (T1036), Command and Control (T1071), Exfiltration (T1041), and Impact (T1565). 5. Protection Recommendations 5.1 For Organizations: Deploy endpoint protection with anti-phishing capabilities, implement application whitelisting, use .cn domain email services, and monitor network traffic with solutions like Antiy XDR. 5.2 For Event Organizers: Secure official websites with HTTPS, enforce code signing, and educate participants about security protocols. 5.3 For End Users: Verify sender authenticity, avoid opening suspicious attachments, and enable file extension visibility.
