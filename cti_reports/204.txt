Review and Outlook of Cybersecurity Threats in 2022  
Digital economy represents the future direction of development. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized in the report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Accelerate the development of the digital economy and promote deep integration between the digital economy and the real economy." Against the backdrop of accelerating global transformations, persistent pandemic impacts, and complex international dynamics, the cybersecurity industry must establish practical, systematic, and normalized security barriers to safeguard digital economic development. Cybersecurity enterprises need to leverage their security product portfolios to address digital data security challenges. At this year's Winter Camp, Antiy released a preliminary version of its annual report to solicit expert feedback, continuing its longstanding tradition. The 2022 report summarizes Antiy's insights on Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), ransomware attacks, cryptojacking malware, botnets, offensive-defensive dynamics, data breaches, industrial internet security risks, and threat generalization: Regarding APT: Antiy analyzed the global distribution and activities of APT groups in 2022, creating the "Geographical Distribution Map of Active APT Operations and Group Affiliations." The Russia-Ukraine conflict caused varying degrees of cyber losses to both parties. Russia's cyber blitzkrieg served as the vanguard in this conflict. Russian operational patterns typically involve initial cyberattacks through phishing campaigns targeting network infrastructure, followed by coordinated kinetic military strikes. Russia's deployment of advanced cyber warfare techniques has influenced global geopolitical dynamics, intensifying regional tensions worldwide. Digital evidence's susceptibility to tampering enables overseas APT groups to conduct false-flag operations. In February 2022, Antiy exposed the India-linked APT group DarkElement, which primarily targets Indian social activists, NGOs, and opposition parties while stealing military-political intelligence from neighboring countries like China and Pakistan. After implanting NetWire RATs, attackers planted fabricated illegal documents containing content such as "arms purchases" and "assassination plots" on victims' devices, then tipped off local police to raid targets' residences and seize these "evidence." APT groups frequently weaponize IoT devices for battlefield prepositioning. Early 2022 revealed OceanLotus compromising Chinese public routers and cameras via weak password brute-force attacks and vulnerabilities, installing traffic forwarding tools to relay Torii RAT communications through multi-layered proxies. Regarding ransomware: While typically criminal tools for financial gain, 2022 saw state-backed groups weaponizing ransomware for political objectives. During the Russia-Ukraine conflict, politically motivated ransomware attacks surged alongside destructive wipers disguised as ransomware. As defense technologies hardened perimeter security, threat actors increasingly recruited insiders for network intrusions. Ransomware strategies evolved from "steal + encrypt" to "steal + delete/destroy" models. Cross-platform ransomware variants enabled infiltration into complex environments, posing new analysis challenges. Cryptojacking trends: Improved evasion techniques enabled mining groups to rapidly integrate new vulnerabilities. Despite cryptocurrency price drops, malicious mining activity intensified with more sophisticated pool connection methods rendering traditional blacklist detection ineffective. Botnet developments: Geopolitically motivated DDoS attacks became major tools for state-level conflicts. Botnets actively exploited newly disclosed vulnerabilities while P2P propagation spread across IoT devices. Offensive-defensive dynamics: The growing asymmetry in defense costs prompted increased automation and AI adoption in security operations. Widespread abuse of payload obfuscation techniques exacerbated cost disparities. Data breaches: Accelerated digital transformation during the pandemic heightened data value and breach frequencies across industries. High-tech sectors suffered most severe breaches, exposing billions globally. Industrial internet risks: Geopolitical conflicts spilled into industrial networks, with over 100 critical vulnerabilities disclosed in industrial infrastructure. Novel attack vectors like "Evil PLC Attack" and darknet markets like "Industrial Spy" emerged, trading stolen industrial data. Threat generalization: Expanding attack surfaces through IoT/OT device vulnerabilities enabled unauthorized access, island-hopping attacks, and critical infrastructure compromises. The 2022 Threat Generalization Map illustrates pervasive risks across smart cities, healthcare, transportation, and energy sectors.
