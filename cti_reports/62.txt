APT Attack Briefing Targeting Cryptocurrency Trading Software  
APT-C-26 (Lazarus), an active APT group observed since 2009, is reportedly linked to multiple high-profile cyberattacks including the 2007 "Operation Flame" DDoS campaign against South Korean government websites, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, the 2016 Bangladesh Bank data breach, and the 2017 global WannaCry ransomware outbreak. Since 2017, the group has expanded its targets for financial gain, shifting focus from traditional financial institutions to global cryptocurrency organizations and individuals. Recent investigations by 360 Core Security's Advanced Threat Response Team revealed Lazarus impersonating the open-source trading platform "Qt Bitcoin Trader" to distribute malware-laced software named "Celas Trade Pro." The cross-platform Windows/Mac applications collect user information upon execution and fetch malicious payloads from cloud servers. The counterfeit software adds an "updater" module containing backdoor code that harvests system data including process lists, computer names, and registry entries, encrypts collected information, and exfiltrates it to C2 servers before executing malicious commands. 360 Security Guard has implemented detection mechanisms against this malware and blocked related distribution websites to prevent further propagation.
