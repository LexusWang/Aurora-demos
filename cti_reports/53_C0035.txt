KV Botnet Activity used acquired Virtual Private Servers as control systems for devices infected with KV Botnet malware.KV Botnet Activity utilizes multiple Bash scripts during botnet installation stages, and the final botnet payload allows for running commands in the Bash shell.KV Botnet Activity focuses on compromise of small office-home office (SOHO) network devices to build the subsequent botnet.KV Botnet Activity command and control activity includes transmission of an RSA public key in communication from the server, but this is followed by subsequent negotiation stages that represent a form of handshake similar to TLS negotiation.KV Botnet Activity involves managing events on victim systems via libevent to execute a callback function when any running process contains the following references in their path without also having a reference to bioset: busybox, wget, curl, tftp, telnetd, or lua. If the bioset string is not found, the related process is terminated.KV Botnet Activity gathers a list of filenames from the following locations during execution of the final botnet stage: \/usr\/sbin\/, \/usr\/bin\/, \/sbin\/, \/pfrm2.0\/bin\/, \/usr\/local\/bin\/.KV Botnet Activity altered permissions on downloaded tools and payloads to enable execution on victim machines.KV Botnet Activity used various scripts to remove or disable security tools, such as http_watchdog and firewallsd, as well as tools related to other botnet infections, such as mips_ff, on victim devices.KV Botnet Activity removes on-disk copies of tools and other artifacts after it the primary botnet payload has been loaded into memory on the victim device.KV Botnet Activity included the use of scripts to download additional payloads when compromising network nodes.KV Botnet Activity involves changing process filename to pr_set_mm_exe_file and process name to pr_set_name during later infection stages.KV Botnet Activity installation steps include first identifying, then stopping, any process containing [kworker\/0:1], then renaming its initial installation stage to this process name.KV Botnet Activity command and control traffic uses a non-standard, likely custom protocol for communication.KV Botnet Activity generates a random port number greater than 30,000 to serve as the listener for subsequent command and control activity.Scripts associated with KV Botnet Activity initial deployment can identify processes related to security tools and other botnet families for follow-on disabling during installation.KV Botnet Activity final payload installation includes mounting and binding to the \/proc\/ filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory while also removing on-disk artifacts.KV Botnet Activity involved removal of security tools, as well as other identified IOT malware, from compromised devices.KV Botnet Activity includes use of native system tools, such as uname, to obtain information about victim device architecture, as well as gathering other system information such as the victim's hosts file and CPU utilization.KV Botnet Activity gathers victim IP information during initial installation stages.
