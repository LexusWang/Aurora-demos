Poisonous Vine APT-C-01 Group Targeted Attacks Against Critical Chinese Institutions in First Half of 2020 Analysis
The Poisonous Vine (APT-C-01) group is an APT organization that has long conducted cyber espionage activities targeting critical domestic defense, government, science and education institutions, with its earliest attack activities traceable to 2007. 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute has maintained continuous tracking of this group's operations. In the first half of 2019, researchers began observing frequent targeted attacks by APT-C-01 against domestic scientific research institutions, military-industrial organizations, defense agencies, aviation entities, and government bodies. Through retrospective analysis using 360 Security Brain, we identified sustained activity from May 2019 onward, with noticeable tactical upgrades since September 2019 and concentrated attacks against key targets. The group's primary targeted attacks in the first half of 2020 included: 1) COVID-19 themed phishing campaigns in early 2020 targeting email credential theft 2) Spearphishing emails with malicious LNK attachments delivering backdoors throughout H1 2023) Focused attacks against specific individual targets in June 2020. Recent observations show renewed concentrated attacks against relevant targets. This report analyzes and summarizes APT-C-01's H1 2020 operations against critical Chinese institutions, with ongoing monitoring of new activities. Impact analysis within 360 Security Brain's data scope reveals primary targets as scientific research institutions (51%), military-industrial organizations, defense agencies, aviation entities, and government bodies. COVID-19 exploitation tactics involved spearphishing emails containing Zhihu platform-redirected links to fake email portals (e.g., http://organization.serveusers.com/index.html via https://link.zhihu.com/?target=). LNK-based attacks employed RAR archives containing malicious LNK files and RTF documents, leveraging mshta.exe for remote HTA execution from C2 servers. Technical artifacts included traditional Chinese comments in HTA files and OLE objects triggering payload deployment to %temp%. March 2020 saw new credential-stealing malware deployments via phishing emails containing ZIP archives. The malware employed multi-stage execution through system.vbs and system.bat files, implementing user deception dialogs, system information collection, document exfiltration targeting specific file extensions, and self-deletion mechanisms. C2 infrastructure analysis revealed continued use of previously disclosed domains (emailser163.serveusers.com) and pastebin.com for HTA storage. MITRE ATT&CK mapping showed techniques including T1268 (Social Engineering), T1193 (Spearphishing Attachment), T1170 (Mshta), and T1059 (Command-Line Interface).
