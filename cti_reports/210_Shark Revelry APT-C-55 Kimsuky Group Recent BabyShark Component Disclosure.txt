Shark Revelry APT-C-55 Kimsuky Group Recent BabyShark Component Disclosure  
In February 2019, a component named BabyShark was discovered targeting US national security think tanks and academic institutions. This component primarily collected confidential and sensitive information from targets, later employed for espionage activities related to nuclear security and Korean Peninsula national security issues, as well as economic gains through encryption industry infiltration. During the first half of 2022, 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute identified multiple attack campaigns from the Kimsuky group using this component, which conducted targeted attacks against specific users with high stealth and increased traceability difficulties through multiple address access requests. Historical BabyShark attacks involved decoy documents to release or download subsequent malicious DLLs, though current decoy documents remain uncaptured. Attackers utilized malicious DLLs to drop VBS scripts, requesting addresses hxxps://api.onedrive.com/v1.0/drives/+path1+/items/+path2+select=id%2C%40content.downloadUrl+authkey to obtain follow-up addresses hxxps://qizzhq.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mz739xHv5A59pON-9E5_f3U7qk1a-Jzwn-C_K-JA3A72_w-5vXa9zAx_YMJfIRdU4. Encrypted data retrieved from these addresses was decrypted and executed via VBS scripts, ultimately exfiltrating user information to APT-controlled server ielsems[.]com. VBS script functionalities include: 1. Checking for dsektop.tmp in %appdata%, decrypting/executing data before deletion; if absent, downloading desktop.tmp from worldinfocontact[.]club. 2. Adding registry key AppXr1bysyqf6kpaq1aje5sbadka8dgx3g4g with code to request dsektop.tmp. 3. Processing script parameters, executing modified commands, and saving to %userprofile%\Microsoft\sys.vbs. 4. Creating scheduled tasks to execute sys.vbs via wscript.exe every 29 minutes. 5. Self-deletion. An iterative BabyShark variant (MD5: 4bb1827e37223b674ab7270f7b7bbb4d) was partially captured, sharing export functions with historical samples like version_hwp.dll and version.dll. Its PDB path H:\HIJACKING\OneDrive_Hijacking\googleDrive_rat_load_complete\googleDrive_rat_load_complete\rat_load\Release\rat_load.pdb matches recent disclosures. Compilation timestamps suggest weaponization upgrades. The DLL constructs path "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\desktop.r5u" and checks file existence for execution flow. Current attacks initially target api.onedrive.com, then redirect to short-link domain qizzhq.dm.files.1drv.com to obscure溯源. While current samples lack post-collection payload downloads, historical patterns indicate subsequent payload retrieval after data exfiltration.
