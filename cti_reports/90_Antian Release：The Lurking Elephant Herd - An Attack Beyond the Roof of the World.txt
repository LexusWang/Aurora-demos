1. Overview
Over the past five years, cyberattacks crossing the "Roof of the World" (the Tibetan Plateau region) targeting China have never ceased. Among these recurring attacks, the group previously dubbed "White Elephant" by Antian has been the most active. From 2012 to 2013, Antian successively captured multiple payload deliveries by this group. In April 2014, Antian disclosed the incident in the "Communications of the China Computer Federation" and again in September at the China Internet Security Conference. In August the same year, Antian produced the report “The Dance of the White Elephant — Review of the HangOver Attack Incident and Partial Sample Analysis” [1], naming this attack as "White Elephant Generation One" in subsequent analyses. By the end of 2015, Antian observed renewed activity from the "White Elephant" group and released a reserve report in July 2016 titled “The Dance of the White Elephant — Cyberattacks from the South Asian Subcontinent” [2], revealing the second wave of attacks from the group, termed "White Elephant Generation Two." At this stage, the main attack focus shifted from Pakistan to China, with a substantial increase in attack capabilities, tactics, and impact compared to Generation One.

After broad exposure, the "White Elephant" group appeared to quiet down for some time but became active again in the latter half of this year. Their recent actions followed months of preparation. According to our intelligence, "White Elephant" is not the sole attack group or campaign from a certain South Asian country; others include the "Arx" group, the "Shakti" campaign, and the "BITTER" campaign, all related and sharing similar characteristics. Most of these campaigns target China. We collectively refer to these groups and campaigns as the "Elephant Herd."

Based on Antian’s own and partner analyses of attacks originating from a certain South Asian country, Antian mapped the timeline of "Elephant Herd" activities. The timeline shows that these attacks have persisted continuously since 2012. Antian engineers believe these attacks reflect the strategic phases and objectives of the country behind them and indicate ongoing investment in cyberspace operations. Although the groups use varying attack methods, they all seek to steal classified information and threaten critical infrastructure systems of the target country. Especially notable are the persistent and direct attacks targeting China’s education, military, research, and other key fields, severely threatening China's technological security. This issue, concerning foreign theft of Chinese scientific research to accelerate their own development, is becoming increasingly visible. While exposing APT events can temporarily deter adversaries, it does not solve the root problem. Effective defense is the foundation of strategic capability; only by establishing an integrated and collaborative defense system can a strong cyber nation be built.

2. "White Elephant" Group: Resurgent Active Attacks

2.1 Introduction to the "White Elephant" Group
Originating from a certain South Asian country, the "White Elephant" group has conducted ongoing cyberattacks against China, Pakistan, and others since 2012, persistently stealing scientific and military data. Antian has monitored and researched this group extensively, publishing disclosures in 2014 and 2016 detailing their activities targeting China. The report “The Dance of the White Elephant — Cyberattacks from the South Asian Subcontinent” analyzed their attack processes and techniques in depth, and mapped their infrastructure. Using technical evidence and resource clues, the group’s profile and partial personnel histories were identified.

After Antian's 2016 disclosure, the group was inactive for a period. In September 2017, Antian detected two attacks targeting China by the group, notably using malicious websites themed around the “China and [South Asian country] border standoff” event as bait, spreading malicious payloads. The group had prepared and executed these operations over several months.

Overall, the group's latest attacks employ similar techniques as before, including "fake phishing sites," "1-day exploits," and "code obfuscation," with some malware detectable by security software. This suggests the group's current capability may still be broad-net casting and exploiting weaker targets. Another possibility is that, linked to China's "return to Doklam" incident, the attacks were rushed and underprepared, limiting their technical sophistication.

2.2 Attack Techniques and Characteristics

Historically, the "White Elephant" group primarily used spear-phishing emails. Most emails contained malicious links crafted to entice victims into clicking, leading to downloading malicious documents exploiting vulnerabilities.

The 2017 activities added website phishing attacks, where fake official sites (e.g., email services) were used to steal user credentials. Additionally, malicious code was embedded in popular event-related websites, tricking users into downloading and executing malicious payloads disguised as updates.

2.2.1 Spear-Phishing Attacks
Spear-phishing is the main attack method of the "White Elephant" group and common in APTs. Unlike generic phishing, spear-phishing targets specific individuals in companies or organizations, using two main methods:

Embedding malicious attachments in emails to lure victims to open them.

Including malicious links in email bodies to redirect victims to malicious sites or download locations.

In the "White Elephant Generation Two" campaign, method 2 predominated, as links avoid attachments, better evading security detection and gaining user trust. These links mostly redirect via third-party domains, commonly t.ymlp52.com.

(The email content concerns the South China Sea issue and urges recipients to click a link to view the “full report.” Clicking downloads a malicious document exploiting CVE-2014-4114, which triggers automatically upon opening due to the PPS format.)

2.2.2 Website Phishing Attacks
The group also employed website phishing. Antian discovered fake NetEase Mail websites targeting Chinese personnel. During the recent Doklam standoff, phishing sites themed around “China and [South Asian country] border standoff” aimed at users concerned about border issues, delivering malicious payloads upon access.

2.2.3 Compromised Websites as C&C Servers
The group uses compromised websites as Command and Control (C&C) servers. Some C&C addresses belong to legitimate websites, likely compromised by the group to host their C&C code, hiding their IPs. This also helps avoid triggering security alerts, as connections appear to legitimate sites.

2.2.4 Modular and Collaborative Operations
In "White Elephant Generation One" attacks, a modular and collaborative approach was observed. Antian engineers found many samples compiled with various compilers and versions. For example, five samples were delivered to the same target:

Sample 4: Initial dropper, capable of downloading other samples

Sample 3: Extracts host info and logs it

Sample 5: Uploads collected data

Sample 6: Collects document information

Sample 2: Keylogger

This indicates coordinated modular operation among samples.

2.3 Payload Analysis (“White Elephant” 2017 Samples)

2.3.1 Malicious Documents
The latest attacks use CVE-2014-4114, CVE-2017-0199, Office DDE penetration, macro code, and embedded OLE clickbait to distribute payloads.

2.3.1.1 Exploiting CVE-2014-4114
The sample is an auto-play Microsoft PowerPoint file that runs upon double-click. It exploits CVE-2014-4114 by using PowerPoint’s OLE PACKAGE loading feature: when loading an INF file, the system calls C:\Windows\System32\InfDefaultInstall.exe to execute the INF file embedded in the PPS file, running malicious code on the victim's computer.

Using 7zip to extract the sample, two files are found in the ppt/embeddings directory, containing IP addresses or executables.

Malicious files embedded in oleObject1.bin are eventually dropped into the system TMP folder.

The INF file executes malicious code named System.exe via C:\Windows\System32\InfDefaultInstall.exe.

2.3.1.2 Exploitation of CVE-2017-0199

CVE-2017-0199 is an Office vulnerability from April 2017. This vulnerability exploits Office OLE object linking technology, embedding malicious linked objects (HTA files) in documents. By crafting the content-type field in the response header, mshta.exe is invoked to execute the downloaded HTA file. Early exploitation methods embedded linked documents via RTF format to trigger the vulnerability and execute HTA code. The White Elephant group uses another exploitation method by adding a script flag in slide1.xml.rels within PPSX format documents to insert links. The SCT file is an XML webpage file embedding VBS code, which downloads and executes other malicious payloads.

Fig 2-12 slide1.xml.rels file

The webpage file content is as follows, calling PowerShell via VBS script to download and execute other files.

Fig 2-13 SCT file content

Fig 2-14 Download and execution of malicious payload

2.3.1.3 Exploitation using DDE

DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) dates back to 1987. It can establish a dynamic data exchange link with a document created by other Microsoft Windows-based programs (when the DDE field is updated, new information is inserted, which linked documents can view). By using the "DDEAUTO" keyword to create a domain code, documents can be constructed to automatically execute domain code. The White Elephant group's latest activity uses this method to embed PowerShell commands into documents; when the document is opened and the user clicks to update the link, the PowerShell command triggers and downloads other malicious payloads for execution.

Fig 2-15 DDE sample

2.3.1.4 Macro code exploitation

The White Elephant group leverages Office's feature of embedded macro code execution, crafting multiple documents with download and execution capabilities. They lure victims to enable macros through the document text. Notably, the White Elephant group also attempts to use Microsoft's built-in PowerShell commands to download samples. The document text and macro code reveal some samples are still in testing and not fully mature. Some malicious macro documents are as follows:

Fig 2-16 Macro virus document 1 text

Fig 2-17 Macro code

Fig 2-18 Macro virus document 2 text

Fig 2-19 Macro code using PowerShell to download and execute malicious samples

2.3.1.5 Embedded OLE object click bait

Some documents in the White Elephant campaign contain embedded OLE objects, where the attacker embeds an OLE object (in this event, the OLE file is an executable) into the document body and uses textual content to lure victims to double-click the OLE object, thus delivering and executing the malicious payload.

Fig 2-20 Document with embedded OLE object

2.3.2 Captured executable files

Currently, the White Elephant group's latest campaign has captured three categories of malicious executable files: simple backdoors and downloader programs with only a few simple commands; full-function backdoor programs containing common backdoor control features; and document exfiltration programs that traverse disks and send documents back to the attacker's server.

2.3.2.1 Simple backdoor and downloader

These samples, once running, set up four timers. Timer controls start background threads before all controls are initialized to receive and execute remote commands, then send the results back to the server for verification. After executing remote commands, the samples download and run other executables, traverse drives, and collect user and file information to send back to the server. Sample information is as follows:

Initialize variables and controls, start Timer1 and Timer4 to execute their functions. After starting Timer1 and Timer2, initialize other controls.

Fig 2-21 Start Timer1 and Timer4

Fig 2-22 Other variable initializations

The sample sets four timers, enabled in the order 1, 4, 2, 3, with the following functions.

Timer1 Analysis

The function corresponding to Timer1_Tick starts a background thread that sends network requests and performs different operations according to the received parameters. The request parameters are AES-encrypted current user usernames (key: "FuckYou").

Fig 2-23 Reporting information and requesting remote commands

Fig 2-24 AES encryption function

When the response contains "cme-update", cmd.exe is invoked to execute the base64-encoded command following "cme-update|", and the execution result is AES-encrypted for verification.

Fig 2-25 Executing remote commands

When the response contains "dv", all logical drive letters are read, encrypted, concatenated with the username, and sent to the server.

Fig 2-26 Traverse drive letters and concatenate into a string

Fig 2-27 Encrypted drive letters returned to server

When the response contains "rr", the specified path from the server ("rr|" followed by path) is traversed; all folder and file names are encrypted and sent back to the server.

Fig 2-28 Obtaining folder names

Fig 2-29 Obtaining file names

Fig 2-30 Sending folder and file names back to server

When the response contains "ue", an executable file is downloaded according to the address (the address following "ue|"), saved with a randomly generated name, and executed.

Fig 2-31 Download and execute file

Fig 2-32 Randomly generated filename

Timer4 Analysis
The main function of Timer4 is to check whether "taskhost.exe" exists in the current user's "ApplicationData" folder; if not, it will download and run it.

Fig 2-33 Download and run hardcoded linked file

Timer2 Analysis
After Timer1 and Timer4 are enabled, control initialization activates Timer2 and Timer3. Timer2’s primary function is to upload the current user's computer information and system information.

Fig 2-34 Upload user computer information

Timer3 Analysis
Timer3’s main function is to remotely download a program named "WinUpdate.exe" and run it.

Fig 2-35 Download and execute "WinUpdate.exe"

2.3.2.2 Full-featured backdoor

This type of sample is a .Net program. Much of its code is obfuscated. It uses the xClient library as the network library (this library can be found on Github, used for implementing remote control software) and the Protobuf library (for parsing data formats) to achieve file downloading, uploading, and receiving remote commands. The sample sets itself to autostart by modifying the registry, traverses disks, resolves actual physical locations from IP addresses, collects system information, and sends them back to the server. Sample tags are listed as follows:

Obfuscated code and use of open-source libraries.

Fig 2-36 Obfuscated code and open-source libraries

Create a mutex to ensure only one instance runs in the system.

Fig 2-37 Locate and create mutex

Obtain basic user information, including geographic location, system information, etc.

Fig 2-38 Get physical location based on IP

Fig 2-39 Obtain detailed system information

Set sample or downloaded malicious code to autostart by modifying the registry.

Fig 2-40 Set autostart

Contains multiple encryption functions, including suspected AES encryption algorithms.

Fig 2-41 Encryption functions

Execute different commands according to the received type, such as download and execute, upload, reconnect to server, disconnect, etc. (backdoor behaviors).

Fig 2-42 Backdoor control commands

2.3.2.3 Document theft samples

Once running, this type of sample obtains all file directories in the system, performs AES encryption on filenames of file types docx, doc, ppt, pptx, pps, xls, xlsx, pdf, and calculates the file hash. Every 10 seconds, it sends the encrypted filenames and file hashes as parameters to the server at 179.48.251.4. After confirming successful transmission, the encrypted filenames are decrypted, and files are uploaded to the same server (using the encrypted filename and file hash as parameters). Sample tags are as follows:

After running, the sample loads all drive names, traverses directories under each drive, searches for files with suffixes docx, doc, ppt, pptx, pps, xls, xlsx, pdf, and calculates the hash of found files’ contents.

Fig 2-43 Backdoor control commands

Fig 2-44 Traverse directories to find files with specified suffixes

Fig 2-45 Calculate file hash

Perform filename concatenation, then AES encrypt the filenames, and BASE64 encode the encrypted result as the return value. A timer is started, executing the Timer_Tick function.

Fig 2-46 Concatenate filenames

Fig 2-47 AES encryption function

Fig 2-48 Filename processing and start timer 1

During control initialization, it can be seen that the timer_Tick function is executed every 10 seconds. It first checks network connectivity, then sends a request to the server with the encoded current username and file hash as parameters, and upon receiving the server response, uploads files accordingly.

Fig 2-49 Set timer interval

Fig 2-50 Network environment detection

Fig 2-51 Upload username and hash

Fig 2-52 AES decryption function

Fig 2-53 Return filename and file hash

Debug information can be queried through tools. The tools released by the malware developer contain debug information. From the debug information, it is found that the developer’s current username is apex, the development tool is Visual Studio 2013, the project is at the default path, and the project name is fileautoscanner2.

2.4 Latest “White Elephant” group activity C&C analysis

The “White Elephant” group was very active in 2017 and began using anti-tracking and anti-attribution measures, setting up interference in relevant C&C. Figures 2-55 and 2-56 show the C&C association graphs for two “White Elephant” operations. The C&Cs involved in the first graph have no anti-attribution configuration, so the data relationships are very clear. In contrast, most C&Cs in the second graph have anti-association configurations, with gray nodes containing hundreds or thousands of associated data, which are not fully expanded. How to analyze the truly related data within this interference is key to tracking and attributing the group.

Fig 2-55 2017 “White Elephant” group activity 1 related C&C distribution

Fig 2-56 2017 “White Elephant” group activity 2 related C&C distribution (gray indicates interference data)

2.5 Attack attribution

Antian’s attribution analysis of the “White Elephant” group was extensively covered in the report “The Dance of the White Elephant — Cyberattacks from the South Asian Subcontinent” and will not be repeated here. The related analysis results have been published in the “2016 China Internet Network Security Report” by the National Internet Emergency Response Center [3].

Antian engineers tracked and attributed the “White Elephant” group through in-depth analysis and ultimately confirmed it originates from a certain South Asian country.

2.5.1 Attack group member analysis

Antian engineers extracted PDB information from 910 sample files and found more than ten different system accounts. Coupled with their use of multiple different development and compilation attacks, it was confirmed that the group’s developers consist of multiple people, and more information about related attack tools was obtained.

Based on comprehensive clues and open internet information, Antian engineers conducted a profile analysis of the attack group and concluded it is a team of about 10 to 16 members. Six of their user IDs are cr01nk, neeru rana, andrew, Yash, Ita nagar, and Naga. The simulated attack group diagram is as follows:

Fig 2-57 Profile of the “White Elephant Generation One” attack group members drawn by Antian engineers

2.5.2 “cr01nk” (“Vishxxx Shaxxx”)

Through analysis and inquiry, Antian engineers confirmed that “cr01nk” is a relatively common personal name in a certain South Asian country. Tracking all usernames finally revealed some information about “cr01nk”; the tracking process is as follows:

On October 27, 2009, someone posted on www.null.co.in seeking “the best ethical hackers,” possibly looking for cybersecurity talent nationwide. In this post, “cr01nk zer0” replied asking about registration methods and communicated with the poster.

Fig 2-58 Snapshot of “cr01nk” online communication

The email address in the above figure is partially hidden by Google, but Antian engineers analyzed other data to reveal the full email address, ID: cr01nk, email: cr01nk@xxail.com.

Fig 2-59 “cr01nk”’s real name

Reverse tracking of the “cr01nk” email showed the nickname (name) is “Vishxxx Shaxxx.” Searching for this name confirmed it is a personal name from a certain South Asian country.

Antian engineers further investigated “cr01nk” based on known information and found this person registered on OpenRCE, a reverse engineering technology forum, where his country is shown as a certain South Asian country.

Fig 2-60 “cr01nk” registered on OpenRCE

From the above information, it is clear that “cr01nk” indeed comes from a certain South Asian country and works as a computer network security professional. From discussion content in Fig 2-65, this person appears to have considerable technical strength.

Fig 2-61 “cr01nk”’s discussion on security technology

From the above analysis, it was found that this person registered at Nullcon. Antian engineers searched his discussion content on Nullcon and discovered he gave a presentation on fuzz testing at NULLCON GOA 2011, demonstrating an example of a PDF format vulnerability.

Fig 2-62 “cr01nk” fuzz testing presentation

At this point, Antian engineers confirmed this person’s name as “Vishxxx Shaxxx.” Further deep digging on social sites found some personal information about him:

“cr01nk” related personal information:

ID: cr01nk, real name: Vishxxx Shaxxx

Graduated in 2009 from a polytechnic institute in a South Asian country. Has worked for McAfee, Security Brigade, National Physical Laboratory, CareerNet, and currently works at his own company Syryodya, an IT service company providing management software for the solar energy industry.

Projects involved: Fuzzing with complexities, Intelligent debugging and in memory fuzzing, Failure of DEP and ASLR, ACM-IIT Delhi and Null Delhi meet, Spraying Just in time

Expertise: Computer security, malware analysis, penetration testing, C/Python/Linux development, and other security research.

Syryodya was founded in 2014, mainly engaged in solar power generation, renewable energy operations management, and internet-related services. Company website: https://www.suryodya.com.

Fig 2-63 Website of “cr01nk”’s Syryodya company

Relationship between “cr01nk” and samples:

There are two samples containing the username “cr01nk,” both compiled on 2009/11/18.

“Vishxxx Shaxxx”’s resume on his personal homepage shows that from May 2009 to June 2010, he did several projects on Freelancer (a crowdsourcing website), including developing trojans and malware specialized for reverse engineering and information gathering for some organizations.

Fig 2-64 “Vishxxx Shaxxx” resume: developed trojans and malware specialized for reverse engineering and information gathering for some organizations

From his personal description, we learn the following two points:

The original compilation path of the "White Elephant" organization’s sample contains the username "cr01nk," which is the online ID of "Vishxxx Shaxxx," indicating that this sample was developed by "Vishxxx Shaxxx" (with a very low probability of the same or deliberately forged ID information).

In the resume of "Vishxxx Shaxxx" ("cr01nk"), he states that he developed malware samples for reverse engineering and espionage for certain organizations.

In summary, Antian engineers speculate that after May 2009, "Vishxxx Shaxxx" ("cr01nk") established contact with the "White Elephant" organization through Freelancer, and later, either hired or joined the group, responsible for developing and reverse engineering malware samples (to evade detection).

By tracking the username, Antian engineers found some information about the "cr01nk" username, locating a computer security professional from a South Asian country. Given this person's research field, online discussion content, and work history, it is evident that he possesses certain technical skills and is likely involved in this attack. Although there is no direct evidence linking this person to the "White Elephant" organization, from the perspective of attack capability, it also shows that this South Asian country indeed has the strength to launch this attack.

2.5.5 Speculative Association with Training Institution

In the report on the "White Elephant" organization, Antian engineers identified six member IDs. Through continuous tracking and analysis, five more member IDs were associated, one of which, named "appin," attracted attention. Analysis revealed this ID belongs to a training institution named "Appin Technology."

When further tracing the Whois information of domains involved in the "White Elephant" attacks, several came from a South Asian country, but most Whois information is currently protected or hidden, and some domains have expired. Two registrars were found as "Appin Technology," which coincidentally matches the above "appin" username, raising suspicion about the connection between the samples and "Appin Technology."

Public information search shows that "Appin Technology" is a training institution in a South Asian country. Its self-introduction page mentions providing "ethical hacker" training. Based on this information, it suggests that attackers from the "White Elephant" organization may have some connection to "Appin Technology." Perhaps some trainees used "Appin Technology" during their training to conduct cyber attacks, or some employees of "Appin Technology" work part-time in such activities.

"Arx" Organization: One of the Few Using 0day Exploits Among the Elephant Group

3.1 Introduction to the "Arx" Organization

The "Arx" organization was exposed in November 2013 [4][5]. The group used a then 0day vulnerability (CVE-2013-3906) to distribute Trojan[Spy]/Win32.Zbot and Trojan/Win32.Dapato malware. It is reported that "Arx" compromised more than 600 targets, many in Pakistan. Although CVE-2013-3906 was also used by the "White Elephant" organization, timing analysis suggests "Arx" likely had earlier access to this vulnerability. From propagation details and final payloads, "Arx" seems unrelated to "White Elephant." However, the attack targets and related C&C infrastructure registration indicate "Arx" may also originate from a South Asian country. The use of 0day exploits suggests "Arx" is one of the earliest and more technically advanced groups among the "elephant" clusters.

3.2 Attack Method: Use of 0day Vulnerability

"Arx" uses typical banking Trojan distribution tactics, commonly sending phishing emails titled "SWIFT Payment" with malware attached, hiding in regular phishing emails.

Retrospective analysis shows "Arx" mainly exploited the 0day vulnerability CVE-2013-3906 for propagation. This is a classic Office document overflow vulnerability caused by a lack of integer overflow check in processing TIFF images, specifically when summing arrays related to strip size. Typical samples embed a TIFF file under the document’s media directory.

The TIFF format is marked by fields, but Word did not validate the "StripByteCounts" field, causing integer overflow and allowing attackers to control program flow, placing shellcode on the heap to execute malicious code.

3.3 Attack Attribution: C&C Infrastructure Usage

Currently known data shows that after exposure, the group ceased activities or went underground, possibly due to stealthy operations and limited information leaks. Known C&C infrastructures mostly date back to 2013 (see Figure 3-6), with many now defunct or abandoned.

"Shakti" Operation: A Four-Year Long Espionage Campaign

4.1 Introduction to "Shakti" Operation [5][6]

The "Shakti" operation was discovered during tracking of the "White Elephant" group. It involves long-term theft of user documents and important files via Trojan malware, ongoing for four years. The targets mainly include Poland, Israel, Palestine, and China. Antian engineers have not found clear links between this and the "White Elephant" organization. The sample’s internal PDB string "Shakti" refers to the Hindu goddess, hence the operation is named after her.

4.2 Payload Analysis

Antian conducted in-depth analysis of "Shakti" samples, with basic info shown in Table 4-1.

Table 4-1 Sample Labels

Analysis revealed the sample encrypts a configuration module in its resource section, containing two encrypted DLL modules. The first DLL handles anti-sandbox, anti-debug, and startup service functions; the second DLL is the core espionage module, stealing system info and user documents. At runtime, the sample decrypts the first DLL in memory and injects the decrypted second DLL into the browser process. Both DLLs run entirely in memory without disk files. The sample’s structure is shown in Figure 4-1.

4.2.1 Main Program Analysis

The main program has two primary functions: decrypting the config file and injecting core modules.

Decrypt Config File

Upon running, it reads a resource section with ID 150 (0x96) labeled "BINARY," encrypted with XOR 0x97.

The malware decrypts the config file with XOR 0x97. The decrypted content includes connected C&C domains, targeted browsers for injection, service names to add, etc. The decrypted config file is:

Injection of Core Modules

The malware uses ReflectiveLoader technology to decrypt two core modules, named Carrier.dll and Payload.dll. Both modules contain PDB debug paths, revealing that they belong to the same project, named "Shakti" (derived from a South Asian country, meaning "goddess").

E:\Projects\ComplexStatement\Shakti\Code\Carrier\Release\Carrier.pdb

E:\Projects\ComplexStatement\Shakti\Code\Payload\Release\Payload.pdb

The main program first decrypts Carrier.dll and sets the entry point to the DLL header. After Carrier.dll completes its operations, it injects the Payload.dll module into the system browser (see Figure 4-4).

4.2.2 Encrypted DLL Module 1: Carrier.dll Module

Global capability-driven security vendors generally use automated analysis systems to process large-scale malware samples and promote sandbox deployments on customer endpoints. In response, APT attackers have developed targeted countermeasures, which are clearly reflected in the "Shakti" samples.

The main functions of the Carrier.dll module are anti-automation analysis and installation deployment, including anti-sandbox, anti-debugging, adding startup entries, adding services, and finally injecting the core Payload.dll into the browser.

Anti-Sandbox

Carrier.dll’s malicious code enumerates current processes and compares their names with known virtual machine or sandbox-related processes; if found, the process exits immediately.

Anti-Debugging

Carrier.dll uses the IsDebuggerPresent function to detect if it is being debugged; if so, the process exits.

Other Anti-Sandbox Methods

The malware also includes additional anti-sandbox techniques.

Adding Auto-Startup

Carrier.dll attempts to add itself to the registry startup keys to achieve persistence.

Enumerating Browsers

Carrier.dll tries to enumerate whether Google Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browsers are installed on the user’s system.

If these browsers are not found running, the malware queries the default browser registry key and launches that process, then injects the malicious DLL into it.

Attempting to Register as a Service

The malware attempts to register itself as a Windows service.

It injects the core data-stealing malicious DLL module (Payload.dll) into the Internet Explorer browser.

4.2.3 Encrypted DLL Module 2: Payload.dll Module Analysis

Payload.dll is the core module of this malware, responsible primarily for collecting user system information such as system name, machine GUID, running process list, and documents stored on user disks.

Creation of Mutex

To prevent multiple instances of the malware from running simultaneously, the malicious code in the Payload.dll module uses the string CStmtMan as a mutex.

Thread Creation

The malware creates threads to search for files of specific formats and exfiltrate them.

The malicious code retrieves the user’s system username and machine GUID, and sends these back to a designated server.

Then the related information is sent back to the hardcoded directory external/update on the malicious command-and-control (C&C) server.

Finally, the malware compares file extensions on the user’s system and exfiltrates files with specific extensions to the server, as shown below:

The malware exfiltrates files with the following extensions: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, txt, rtf, pdf, sql, inp, indicating that data theft of these files is the main purpose of this attack group.

4.3 Attack Attribution

4.3.1 C&C Analysis

Antianalyzes found that the "Shakti" attack samples involve three domains:

web4solution.net

securedesignus.com

securedesignuk.com

According to WHOIS queries (basic information shown in Table 4-2), all three domains were registered by the same individual or organization located in a certain South Asian country. The registrant’s name is a common name from this country, and one domain recently applied WHOIS privacy protection.

Table 4-2 Basic information of the three C&C domains

4.3.2 Timestamp Analysis

Analysis of timestamps from captured "Shakti" samples shows that most were developed in 2012 and 2014 (see Table 4-3).

Table 4-3 Timestamp information of "Shakti" samples

The earliest timestamp is from 2012, coinciding with the active start of the "White Elephant" group, though the attackers began domain registration as early as 2010. Small-scale espionage attacks began in 2012, peaked in 2014, and WHOIS privacy protection started in August 2017 (timeline shown in Figure 4-21). The domain web4solution.net remains active, supporting a four-year ongoing attack campaign. The attacks likely went undetected because they targeted only a few valuable victims rather than widespread targets. The two DLL components are functionally clear and effective, possibly the final payload of an APT group aimed at data theft. Analysis shows the malware is not linked to any known exposed APT malware.

The PDB path containing the string "Shakti" (a term from a South Asian language), combined with the registrant’s name and geographic location, firmly attributes this attack to a certain South Asian country.

"BITTER" Operation: A Targeted Attack Often Overlooked

5.1 Introduction to "BITTER" Operation

The "BITTER" operation was exposed in October 2016 [8]. It mainly used spear-phishing emails and a series of attack components targeting Pakistan. The attackers are believed to have participated in multiple cyberattack campaigns. Antianalyzes suggest a close connection between this operation and a South Asian country, marking it as an often overlooked targeted attack within the "Elephant Herd" cluster.

5.2 Attack Methodology Analysis

5.2.1 Most Common Attack Method: Spear-Phishing Emails

"BITTER" operation commonly used spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads, often attaching classic vulnerability exploitation documents based on CVE-2012-0158 or executable files disguised as images to lure victims into opening them.

Some exploited documents used in this operation include:
Requirement List.doc, Cyber Espionage Prevention.doc, New email guidelines.doc, Gazala-ke-haseen-nagme.doc, Rules.xls

5.2.2 RAT Components: Data Theft Module

Some RAT components used in the "BITTER" operation can log files and timestamps on infected hosts. A 2014 sample had hardcoded file types to collect specified file types.

5.2.3 RAT Components: Android Module

While analyzing a PC RAT sample’s C&C domain in the "BITTER" operation, researchers found two Android RAT samples using the same C&C domain, indicating the "BITTER" operation spans both PC and mobile platforms.

Android RAT is an open-source remote administration tool for Android, available on GitHub with the following functionalities:

➢ Retrieve contacts (and all related information)
➢ Obtain call logs
➢ Retrieve all messages
➢ GPS / Network location tracking
➢ Monitor received messages
➢ Real-time monitoring of call status (incoming, outgoing, missed calls)
➢ Take photos using the camera
➢ Stream audio from the microphone (or other sources)
➢ Stream video (only for activity-based clients)
➢ Display toast-style notifications
➢ Send SMS
➢ Make phone calls
➢ Open a URL in the default browser
➢ Vibrate the phone

Among the Android RATs used in the "BITTER" operation, one was disguised as an Islamic alarm clock, and another was disguised as a Kashmir news app (Kashmir being a disputed territory between India and Pakistan). This operation is one of the rare cyberattacks leveraging Android RATs.

5.2.4 RAT Component: Remote Control Module

The "BITTER" operation employed RATs compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0. Early versions sent HTTP POST requests unencrypted, communicating with the C&C server in plaintext.

The latest RAT versions used in ongoing activities support the following backdoor functions, enabling attackers to fully control the victim’s PC remotely:

➢ Retrieve system information — computer name, current username, and OS
➢ Enumerate logical drives
➢ Enumerate and log files with timestamps
➢ Open a remote command shell
➢ List processes with active UDP connections
➢ Control running processes
➢ Execute files
➢ Download files

Some RAT programs in the "BITTER" operation carry digital signatures with untrusted CA root certificates:

5.3 Attack Source Speculation

Though the "BITTER" operation is not highly complex, its activities easily blend into widespread cyberattacks. It uses common online services like free Dynamic DNS (DDNS), dedicated server hosting, and Gmail for its C&C infrastructure. However, based on its targets and behavioral characteristics:

The spear-phishing emails target Pakistani domains, suggesting the attacker may be from a South Asian country based on geopolitical context;

Some samples disguise themselves as "Kashmir" news apps—a known conflict-prone region;

The emails and data show high proficiency in English, indicating the attackers may be fluent in English or come from a country where English is an official language.

It is clear that the "BITTER" operation is a targeted attack, with strong evidence linking it to a South Asian country.

Summary and Reflections

6.1 The Defender’s Unyielding Will is the Premise for Combating Persistent Attacks

Antian has disclosed detailed information on the "White Elephant" group and several other groups from the same South Asian country. Their long-term involvement and investment in cyberspace competition are evident. While we continuously monitor and analyze their evolving APT campaigns, these groups keep upgrading their tactics and capabilities, and exposure does not halt their activities. Attackers constantly update malware source code, exploit new vulnerabilities, and procure the latest commercial hacking tools. Some groups even fully evade previously known behavior patterns and attack resources.

This report is a reserved document by Antian and not a hot-topic release. Since early 2017, Antian has adopted a more cautious stance toward public APT disclosures, aiming to improve defense rather than create hype. After exposing the "White Elephant" group in July 2016, their capabilities were effectively curtailed. Public exposure raises attackers’ operational costs and reduces their target scope, while providing defenders with moral and informational advantages and deeper threat awareness. However, exposure also forces attackers to refine their resources, art, and strategies, leading to more sophisticated attacks. Hence, defending against APTs requires long-term, sustained, and systematic security investments.

Threats result from the product of capabilities and intent. APTs represent both sophistication and persistence. While countering sophistication depends largely on reasonable defense deployment, investment, and capability, countering persistence tests the defender’s resilience and mental fortitude. Basic defensive competence is the foundation against advanced threats, and the defender’s unwavering resolve is essential to combat persistent attacks.

6.2 Lessons for China’s Science and Technology Security in Cyberspace

It is notable that these attacks "crossing the Roof of the World" are not narrowly targeting China’s military or political entities but broadly focus on universities, research institutions, and comprehensive targets. Viewing such attacks as "shooting the rabbit while grabbing the grass" understates the comprehensive risk posed by APTs. For a country aspiring to be a great power with a robust industrial system and comprehensive scientific development, the desire for technological breakthroughs is evident. China’s development from independence and self-reliance through reform and opening-up represents an exemplary model for developing countries. However, this growth must be based on proactive outputs aligned with national interests, not through theft and low-cost imitation by others. Without effective cybersecurity capabilities, the technologies and breakthroughs achieved with "blood, sweat, and tears" become easy targets for copying.

Over a long development period, China humbly learned as a "disciple" and "latecomer," focusing mostly on the political, economic, and military impacts of network intrusions, with insufficient concern for the intellectual property theft and imitation by competing nations or regions, and less attention to supply chain security risks. Today, China is transitioning from a follower to a leader in many fields; from a technology importer to an exporter; from a runner-up to a co-runner and leader. China’s cybersecurity perspective must shift from a weak player’s to a strong player’s viewpoint—from narrow network self-protection to one safeguarding sovereignty, security, and development interests.

Cybersecurity is a complex, multi-dimensional non-traditional security threat closely tied to traditional security domains. In April 2014, General Secretary Xi Jinping first proposed the “Overall National Security Concept,” covering 11 security domains including "science and technology security." This was reiterated in the 19th Party Congress report, emphasizing integrating development with security, strengthening crisis awareness, and preparing for potential risks. Under these new mandates, universities, research institutes, research management agencies, and technology innovators must build effective protection capabilities for scientific achievements and technology security to ensure international strategic competitiveness.

As General Secretary Xi pointed out, "the connotation and extension of China’s national security today is broader than ever before; its spatial-temporal scope is wider than ever; internal and external factors are more complex than ever." In this grand new era, as China moves from a major cyber power to a cyber superpower, it will safeguard the vast digital ocean of cyberspace.

We plan to release this reserved report as 2017 ends, looking forward to a 2018 full of opportunities and challenges. This summary is Antian’s New Year message.
