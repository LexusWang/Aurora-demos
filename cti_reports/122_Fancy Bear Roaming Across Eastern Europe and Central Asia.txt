Fancy Bear Roaming Across Eastern Europe and Central Asia  
APT-C-20, also known as (APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, STIONTIUM), is an APT group with military intelligence background whose earliest attack activities can be traced back to 2004-2007. Primary targets include government agencies, diplomatic institutions, and research organizations in North America and Europe. 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute monitoring reveals recent active campaigns by APT28, while foreign security researchers shared numerous suspected APT28 attack samples on Twitter. Through analysis with 360 Security Brain threat intelligence data, we traced the complete context of recent APT28 attacks, confirming their focus on Central Asian institutions. Attack Campaign Analysis: Through 360 Security Brain's correlation analysis, we identified initial attacks via malicious attachments containing Zebrocy downloader – APT28's exclusive tool frequently used in historical operations. Three attack campaigns targeting Central Asian institutions were observed in May 2020 with related malicious attachments: cd0aa9b954010b704f741debf46ade5e (the-chief-of-the-sanitary-inspection-armed-forces-for-movement-of-allied-military-personnel-in-the-territory.rar), e9bf5ce92b9d286fdc66616ca2cc5c68 (gai-18.rar), 1ce718ba64b85b58a3dfbd3a7b207990 (ucx.no.-745_14-05-2020.rar), 82e0597f56653a8788bfb531af460eb0 (national_drug_report_2020[7294].rar), 88ce694a89cc1d381818a61d9494ba58 (DN-098-2020_MFA.rar). The May 14 attack used bait documents related to military COVID-19 guidance from Wrocław's Military Center of Preventive Medicine, coinciding with Poland-Czech border tensions reported by CNN on June 12, indicating APT attacks often precede real-world geopolitical conflicts. About Zebrocy: APT28 historically employs Zebrocy Downloader variants (Delphi, Nim, AutoIt, VB.NET, Visual C++, C#, Go) for reconnaissance and payload deployment. Initial vectors include exploit documents or phishing attachments containing both Zebrocy and decoy files. Core functions include screenshot capture, system information collection (OS version, installed software, disk info), command execution via cmd.exe, and deployment of secondary payloads (Xagent Backdoor, Delphi Backdoor, Golang Backdoor). Sample Analysis: Recent attack chain begins with DN-098-2020_MFA.rar containing Delphi Zebrocy (md5:88ce694a89cc1d381818a61d9494ba58). Upon execution, the downloader copies itself to C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Tools\[hex]\sqlclient.sys, displays fake error messages, captures screenshots (base64-encoded), and communicates with C2 (185.234.52.168/buildings.php). Post-compromise activities include scheduled tasks for payload delivery and cleanup operations. Sample correlations show consistent Zebrocy TTPs: hexadecimal string encoding, timer callback functions for C2 communication, and base64 screenshot exfiltration – matching historical patterns documented by ESET. Conclusion: APT28's 2020 campaigns maintain geopolitical alignment, with cyber operations closely tied to real-world military tensions. Continuous monitoring through 360 Threat Intelligence Cloud and APT Panoramic Radar is ongoing. Organizations should conduct IOC-based investigations using provided indicators.
