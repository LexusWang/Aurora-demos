The severe pandemic has brought about significant societal changes. If there is any positive significance, it has to some extent ignited the trend of remote work ahead of schedule, formally unveiling the grand stage of China's digital transformation in the era of "mobile cloud security". The pandemic has catalyzed an epic shift to nationwide remote work. Stimulated by this new industry norm, global corporate demand for VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) has surged. Since its inception, the combination of "VPN + firewall" has become the optimal pairing for traditional enterprise network security interconnection by providing encrypted secure communication channels and data transmission pathways for businesses. It can be said that the core enabler of remote work is the VPN. Remote users or business partners can penetrate enterprise network boundaries through VPN tunnels to access internal resources, granting them local access privileges even when outside the corporate network. VPNs Are No Longer Secure: Frequent Vulnerability Exploits Recently, 360 Security Brain exclusively uncovered an APT attack activity by the foreign APT group Darkhotel (APT-C-06), which exploited a vulnerability in a certain VPN vendor's device to achieve intrusion, hijacking, and the delivery of malicious files. Several of China's overseas institutions and related government units suffered varying degrees of attack. This concrete APT attack report exposes the security risks of VPNs at the device level: cybercriminals scan for large numbers of unpatched VPN devices, gain remote access, view administrative logs to obtain administrator passwords, access the entire network, disable multi-factor authentication, thereby paralyzing the entire IT system. However, this approach is not an isolated case. Traditional VPNs have now become a favorite target for cybercriminals, and such security incidents are becoming increasingly common. The Second Layer of VPN Insecurity: The Impact of "Borderless" Of course, the inherent vulnerabilities of VPNs are only the first layer of insecurity; the "borderless" impact is the more fatal reason why VPNs fail to meet the security needs of government and enterprises. What is "borderless"? In the past, traditional security architectures fabricated a clear "internal-external boundary," seen as the "protective wall" of enterprise security. Just as enterprise servers and terminal devices were primarily used within the internal network, a "wall" was deployed at the boundary of the data center to block external threats—this is the well-known defense model based on the physical boundary of a firewall. Nowadays, this traditional security boundary is becoming obsolete. Further, the rise of new technologies like cloud computing, mobile internet, IoT, and 5G is transforming enterprise IT architectures from "bounded" to "borderless." This is quite straightforward: if an enterprise embraces cloud computing, it cannot possibly house all clouds within its own firewall; if it embraces mobile work and IoT, it cannot extend the firewall to every endpoint; if it also embraces big data and artificial intelligence, it inevitably exchanges data with external partners... Therefore, the physical security boundary of firewalls is outdated. This brings us to a fundamental premise of VPN construction and deployment: it is based on the enterprise boundary. The entire premise of VPNs is that "the internal network is trusted, the external network is high-risk." In other words, VPNs rely on the "boundary" for security judgment, granting implicit or explicit trust to remote access and mobile employees. Any user within the boundary of the local area network is "inherently trusted." This outdated perception of VPNs is fatal, leaving attackers with a broader attack surface. Because "borderless" means threats can originate from anywhere; any device or stolen user credentials could become a pivot for network intrusion. Even the internal network poses significant risks, bringing larger attack surfaces, more complex attacks, and escalating security threats. The Concept of "Zero Trust," Timely and Apt The times have changed, and so have the rules of network access. "Access under boundaries" has reached its end. However, vendors remain calm; they have found a survival strategy suited to this era. In a sense, "Zero Trust" is currently the most ideal approach. Zero Trust, as the name suggests, has a core philosophy of trusting no one—no person, device, or system inside or outside the network. This model adheres to the principle of "never trust, always verify." It requires verifying every person, device, or account attempting to connect to enterprise applications or systems before granting access permissions. Zero Trust security centers on identity for dynamic network access control. Against the backdrop of the fading traditional boundary-based enterprise security protection system, Zero Trust security has become the mainstream security technology roadmap for the next generation. Because the premise of Zero Trust is distrust; only by trusting no one can you trust what you can trust. How Does SDP Technology Based on "Zero Trust" Solve These Problems? When traditional security mechanisms fail to meet enterprise demands for mobility, dynamism, and real-time capabilities, a technological revolution in network security architecture is underway against the backdrop of the "cloud era" and the "borderless" era. SDP technology based on "Zero Trust" is replacing VPN technology. SDP stands for Software Defined Perimeter, a next-generation cybersecurity model proposed by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) in 2013 based on the Zero Trust concept. The granting of enterprise access permissions should not be a static "assumption of trust" but rather a dynamic "real-time control." Therefore, the design philosophy of SDP Zero Trust is "authenticate first, connect next, access last." It centers on user identity, no longer distinguishing between internal and external networks. All connections are Zero Trust; even after a connection is established, every mutual access requires re-verification. SDP technology is demonstrating increasing technical advantages, especially in the "Zero Trust" era, where it is even reshaping the definition of remote access. First, let's look at the security advantages of SDP: (1) Minimizing the attack surface and reducing security risks. Despite the continuous increase in internal devices like employees, contractors, and partners, all SDP users and devices are subject to access control, even down to granular risk monitoring of actions most prone to information leaks like copying, screenshotting, and printing. (2) Possessing network invisibility to evade potential cyberattacks. On one hand, IT administrators can block specific users outside the virtual perimeter while minimizing the opening of network ports to reduce attacks exploiting network protocol vulnerabilities. This effectively avoids expanding the attack surface and enhances overall network security. (3) Enabling pre-emptive vetting, significantly improving security performance. SDP pre-vets and controls all connections. Which devices, which services, and which facilities can connect must all obtain the appropriate "pass" permissions in advance. Therefore, its overall security is superior to traditional architectures. On the other hand, from an operational perspective, the operational advantages of SDP technology also cater to enterprise development needs: It's well-known that the traditional enterprise security model centered around VPNs requires significant equipment and manpower to operate, resulting in high costs and poor flexibility. The operational advantage of SDP lies in not only reducing equipment procurement and support costs for enterprises and the complexity of staff operating devices but also enhancing IT operational flexibility to meet and respond to business and security needs faster. Furthermore, SDP and cloud architectures can also achieve "seamless integration." By reducing the required security architecture, SDP supports applications in public cloud, private cloud, data center, or hybrid cloud environments, helping enterprises rapidly, controllably, and securely adopt cloud architectures. Best Practice for Enterprise Secure Access: "360 Secure Access Cloud" Empowers Enterprise Cloud Invisibility Leveraging the multiple advantages mentioned above, 360 Security Brain has tailored the "360 Secure Access Cloud" for enterprises around SDP technology. Based on the principles of least privilege and shortest authorization, it integrates SDP Accepting Host (AH) and SDP Controller functions, interfaces with optional authentication and authorization services, and enables continuous risk assessment. Empowered by the 360 Security Brain, it establishes a complete secure access platform. Simply put, 360 Secure Access Cloud constructs a virtual boundary for enterprises, unifying internal network services and external SaaS services into a secure resource pool for SDN scheduling management, forming mapped IPs. Simultaneously, it manages access platforms for enterprise office terminals, BYOD, browsers, etc., resolving them to public IPs. The deployment architecture diagram of the "360 Secure Access Cloud" platform is explained as follows: 1. Set ACLs (Access Control Lists) on protected business systems to only allow access from IP addresses of the Pan-Cloud system; 2. Place protected business systems on the public network, assigning public IP addresses; 3. Add DNS resolution records for the protected business system domains within the 360 Pan-Cloud Security Protection System; 4. The Pan-Cloud system generates corresponding mapped IP addresses; 5. Configure private DNS resolution records in the 360 Enterprise Browser management backend to point business system domains to the mapped IPs generated by the Pan-Cloud system; 6. Configure business application navigation (system name + system domain) in the 360 Enterprise Browser management backend. In this way, after passing identity verification or device verification, enterprise users obtain responsive configuration policies. When users access protected business systems, the platform resolves the request based on the mapping relationship, sends data packets to the enterprise business system, retrieves the response data, and finally presents it to the user. Throughout the entire access process, enterprise users can confidently retrieve information and data from the corporate intranet, significantly enhancing the security of enterprise network interconnection. Overall, 360 Secure Access Cloud offers the following four major security advantages: 1. Helps enterprise applications and servers achieve invisibility on the network, reducing the risk of customer business systems being attacked; 2. Provides enterprises with a more flexible VPN alternative, making remote work more convenient and secure; 3. Supports enterprise business development by providing a consistent application access experience for enterprise users, regardless of their current network location; 4. Empowers through the 360 Security Brain, integrating with Vulnerability Cloud, Knowledge Base Cloud, Threat Intelligence Cloud, and the multi-dimensional analysis engine including Kill Cloud, Sandbox Cloud, and Analysis Cloud. From an enterprise perspective, remote work requires a comprehensive consideration of cost and security issues, including multi-application traffic, high security, and low cost. 360 Secure Access Cloud utilizes an identity-based access control mechanism to cloak enterprise applications and services in a "cloak of invisibility," effectively protecting core enterprise resources and data. With unique advantages in security and stability, high efficiency, and low cost, 360 Secure Access Cloud becomes a superior choice to replace the traditional VPN network model. Change is constant, and so are security threats. Remote work under pandemic conditions forces enterprises to accelerate their search for a safer, more efficient path to counter potential security threats. The transformations of the new era endow enterprise network security with more innovative and enriched connotations. Starting from the fundamental need for enterprise security, 360 Security Brain, leveraging years of accumulated security protection experience and technical advantages, has pioneered the adoption of Zero Trust principles to build the 360 Secure Access Cloud. This prevents the lateral spread of internal threats, creates a unique intranet ecosystem for enterprise users, forming a complete closed loop encompassing terminal devices, transmission channels, and identity permissions. This ensures secure and stable access to internal enterprise resources and data, building a borderless security gateway for enterprise remote work.
