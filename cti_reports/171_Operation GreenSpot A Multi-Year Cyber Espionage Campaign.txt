Operation GreenSpot A Multi-Year Cyber Espionage Campaign  
For several years, Antiy has vigilantly monitored, analyzed, and tracked various APT attacks targeting China, cautiously disclosing activities or attack tool analyses of threat actors including OceanLotus (APT-TOCS), White Elephant, and Equation, while maintaining continuous monitoring of numerous other groups. This report focuses on pre-2015 activities of a geopolitically motivated actor named "GreenSpot" after marine life associated with its region. To enhance Chinese users' security awareness and promote cybersecurity development, Antiy releases this report. GreenSpot primarily employs internet-exposed assets as entry points, utilizing social engineering emails combined with vulnerability exploitation, with suspected activity spanning over a decade. 1.1 Suspected Early-Stage (2007) Operations During 2007 incident response, Antiy extracted payload behaviors from compromised servers (Table 1-1). Most tools were open-source/ freeware, exhibiting DIY characteristics that bypassed detection while lacking rootkit stealth. Attackers achieved persistence via startup items, remote shell control via NC, system reconnaissance via Mt1.exe, and data exfiltration through Spooler.exe (disk logging), keylog.exe (keystroke capture), Rar.exe (file collection), and HTTP.exe (exfiltration). The operational style showed influences from early penetration testing methodologies like Coolfire. 1.2 2011-2015 Campaigns Post-2010 capabilities evolved with 1day/aged vulnerability adaptation, customized exploit tools, and self-developed malware. Targets included Chinese government agencies and aerospace/military research institutions. GreenSpot distributed RATs via spear-phishing emails containing malicious MHT documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158, simultaneously displaying decoy content. Antiy's analysis revealed近百IoC indicators and reconstructed 2011-2014 timelines (Figure 1-3). 1.3 Recent Activity (2017) Post-2015 operations continued with new infrastructure storing Poison Ivy variants in web directories (Figure 1-5). Attack chains involved Office document exploits (CVE-2017-8759) delivering multi-stage payloads connecting to legacy C2 domains (pps.*.com). 2.1 Case Analysis GreenSpot employed two payload types: PE binders displaying decoy documents and vulnerability-exploiting MHT files. Both delivered update.exe to startup folders for persistence. Temporal analysis showed binder usage followed failed vulnerability attempts. Multiple cases reused document templates from official Chinese websites (e.g., NPC content in Figure 2-3). 3.1 CVE-2012-0158 Exploitation GreenSpot innovated MHT-based exploitation (vs traditional RTF) by embedding CLSIDs directly in MHT files (Figure 3-4), evading signature detection. The campaign predated third-party threat intelligence MHT detections by months (Figure 3-5), demonstrating early adoption of anti-detection techniques for aged vulnerabilities. 3.3 CVE-2017-8759 Exploitation 2017 samples leveraged .NET WSDL parsing flaws via RTF documents auto-downloading HTA scripts (Figure 3-6-3-9) executing Poison Ivy variants. 4.4 Malware Relationships Cross-case analysis revealed infrastructure overlaps (Figure 4-3-4-4), shared C2 domains (Table 4-3-4-4), and geographic/IP clustering (AS3462/18182). Poison Ivy variants showed identical XOR decryption routines across 2011-2017 campaigns (Figure 5-1). 5.3 C2 Infrastructure Links 2017 domains geiwoaaa.xxx.com and historical givemea.xxx.com resolved to overlapping IP ranges (114.42.xxx.xxx), with pps.xxx.com previously pointing to 45.77.xxx.xxx. 6. Conclusion GreenSpot represents a persistent regional threat targeting Chinese strategic sectors through recycled vulnerabilities, social engineering, and customized RATs (Poison Ivy, Gh0st, ZXShell). Despite lacking 0day capabilities, its anti-detection techniques and infrastructure reuse demonstrate operational maturity. Defense requires layered protections including email filtering, endpoint hardening, and continuous vulnerability management. APT resilience demands comprehensive security architectures covering all attack surfaces, emphasizing proactive defense postures and situational awareness.
