Great Power Rivalry US Condor and Russian Bear Cyber Deterrence Strategy Confrontation
In the cybersecurity domain, "muscle-flexing" has become a crucial manifestation of national comprehensive strength projection. As the United States and Russia maintain continuous confrontations in political and military spheres, both parties have also engaged in cyber operations. This article analyzes the strategic game between major powers in cyberspace through the lens of the "layered cyber deterrence" concept proposed in the Cyber Solarium Commission (CSC) report, examining the confrontation between the American Condor and the Russian Bear. In March 2020, the "layered cyber deterrence" concept formally entered the security community. Simply put, it advocates addressing cyber threats through deterrence measures rather than immediate escalation to armed conflict, thereby achieving greater national influence at lower costs. In reality, cyber attacks below the threshold of armed conflict have become commonplace in contemporary cyberspace. The deterrence approach to safeguarding cyberspace security and discourse power has proven to be a viable reference. Recent U.S. operations against Russia demonstrate the application of this strategy. The layered cyber deterrence strategy comprises three components: 1) Shaping behavior through establishing cyber rules based on shared interests and values, rewarding compliance and punishing violations â€“ essentially seeking allies to promote "responsible behavior in cyberspace"; 2) Denying benefits through public-private partnerships to reduce vulnerabilities, making attacks against the U.S. more difficult or unprofitable; 3) Imposing costs by utilizing all policy tools including military means to disrupt or prevent sub-threshold cyber operations at their source, with potential military responses at chosen times and locations. All three layers remain at the deterrence level, regulating national behavior through rules. Violations triggering U.S. "retaliation" are described without clear definitions of retaliatory actions or boundaries. Notably, the CSC report explicitly identifies Russia as a primary cybersecurity threat, particularly citing election interference undermining public trust in U.S. democratic institutions. Deterrence weaponization manifests in three forms: 1) Publishing security reports disclosing adversarial cyber activities has become a classic deterrence tactic. Recent months saw two extensive U.S. reports accusing Russia of cyber attacks, linking operations to government entities while emphasizing their scale and duration. The March 2020 report from a major U.S. intelligence contractor detailed GRU's 15-year cyber campaign, connecting FancyBear and Sandworm APTs to Russian military operations. Notably, mentioned countries like Denmark relate to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. Subsequent June revelations about Secondary Infektion's six-year disinformation campaign coincided with U.S.-Russia tensions over nuclear posture and espionage cases. 2) Official attribution carries greater deterrence weight. The NSA's May 2020 advisory directly linking Sandworm to ongoing CVE-2019-10149 exploitation against Exim servers transformed ordinary vulnerability exploitation into geopolitical signaling. 3) Tentative attribution using terms like "likely" or circumstantial evidence creates accumulated reputational damage. The Minuteman III document leak attributed to Russian hackers via Maze ransomware connections exemplifies this approach, timed with Putin's nuclear posture announcement as reciprocal deterrence. Cyber deterrence is evolving into a common tool for major power rivalry and non-kinetic probing. U.S. practices demonstrate three characteristics: 1) Accelerating cybersecurity alliance-building through coordinated condemnation like the multinational rebuke of Georgia cyber attacks; 2) Pursuing proactive cyber initiatives through bug bounties and joint reports to raise adversary costs; 3) Leveraging full-spectrum political tools including official condemnations, multi-agency responses, and economic sanctions like the Entity List to convey escalatory deterrence signals.
