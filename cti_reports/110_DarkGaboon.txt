The group uses Revenge RAT and document templates downloaded from legitimate Russian financial websites.
DarkGaboon signs malicious code with fake X.509 certificates allegedly issued in the names of Russian companies.
DarkGaboon employs homoglyphs in the names of malicious samples.
The group is well-versed in the naming conventions of Russian documents and familiar with Russian-language terminology.

Introduction
In mid-October 2024, the Cyber Intelligence Department of Positive Technologies’ Expert Security Center (PT Expert Security Center) detected a targeted campaign involving Revenge RAT, aimed at employees in the financial departments of Russian companies. Particular attention was drawn to the attackers’ command infrastructure, which featured unusual African-themed names. A deeper investigation uncovered a new, previously undocumented APT group that has been targeting Russian companies since at least May 2023. Due to the use of African names, regular updates to samples and lures, “spotted” naming of malicious files, and prolonged stealth in cyberspace, the group was dubbed DarkGaboon, after the Gaboon viper native to the area near the stratovolcano Kilimanjaro.

First Detected Attack
In October 2024, PT Expert Security Center’s internal cyber intelligence systems identified an attack by DarkGaboon targeting a Russian bank. An email titled “Reconciliation of Mutual Settlements” was sent to a corporate address at one of the bank’s regional branches. It contained a well-written cover message in Russian on accounting topics and a lure archive titled “Reconciliation Report.z”. The archive included:

A clean Microsoft Excel document template downloaded from a Russian financial website

A Russian-language note urging users to open the files only on a computer

A malicious payload in the form of a Revenge RAT file protected with .NET Reactor, disguised with a PDF icon

The malicious email was sent using a stolen email address — nina.romanenko.1985@mail[.]ru — which had previously been compromised via a stealer infecting the device of its legitimate owner. On the day of the attack, after several Revenge RAT samples were successfully sent, the email account was blocked by the email provider.

The command-and-control infrastructure included a Windows node located outside Russia (IP: 31.13.224[.]86) hosting the Revenge RAT control panel and Dynamic DNS domains with African-themed names such as kilimanjaro.run[.]place and kilimanjaro.cloudns[.]nz.

Network Infrastructure Analysis
A deeper investigation was triggered by the discovery of a cluster of 11 Revenge RAT samples and 8 associated Dynamic DNS domains — all tied to the "kilimanjaro" naming theme. As of October 21, 2024, all 8 Dynamic DNS domains were delegated to a single server located in Bulgaria:
31.13.224.86
kilimanjaro.cloudns.nz
kilimanjaro.run.place
kilimanjaro.theworkpc.com
kilimanjaro.bigmoney.biz
kilimanjaro.crabdance.com
kilimanjaro.dns.army
kilimanjaro.hopto.org
burkinafaso.duckdns.org

Comprehensive research into the discovered samples and infrastructure revealed that all were operated by the same group, whose activity targeting Russian companies dates back to at least May 2023. However, unlike in October 2024, earlier operations used only one Dynamic DNS domain and a rotating set of C2 servers that changed approximately once per month, all hosted outside Russia (cluster: rampage).

31.13.224.86 (Oct 3, 2024 – Bulgaria)
91.92.255.100 (Jan 12, 2024 – Bulgaria)
94.156.71.238 (Nov 9, 2023 – Bulgaria)
94.156.161.83 (Oct 13, 2023 – Italy)

193.235.147.38 (Sep 18, 2023 – Netherlands)
62.233.57.160 (Aug 21, 2023 – Czech Republic)

PDNS records for the Bulgarian server at 31.13.224[.]86 clearly indicate the delegation of both the rampage and kilimanjaro clusters to it, with about a one-week gap in timing.

Several Revenge RAT samples from the DarkGaboon arsenal — compiled in summer 2024 but used in attacks only in autumn — experienced this “transition period” in the group’s infrastructure. These samples, though still referencing the old domain rampage.myvnc[.]com, connected to the new Bulgarian server at 31.13.224[.]86, which had simultaneously been assigned the new kilimanjaro-themed Dynamic DNS domains (highlighted in purple in the network diagram).

Additionally, the use of both rampage and kilimanjaro clusters by the same group is supported by the similarity of Revenge RAT sample names, delivery methods, lure documents, and the use of identical fake X.509 certificates (highlighted in green in the network diagram).

There is no doubt that the attacks of 2023 and 2024 using the kilimanjaro and rampage cluster infrastructures were carried out by the same group — DarkGaboon. The "transition period" and infrastructure switch in the fall of 2024 are due to the fact that, although the group remained under the radar of cyber intelligence tools for a long time, by August 2024 the use of the rampage cluster had become unreliable and ineffective for attackers after it appeared in FinCERT's IOC feeds. We believe this is the reason for the abrupt change of the control Dynamic DNS domain from the rampage cluster and its replacement with a whole group of receivers from the kilimanjaro cluster, as well as mistakes made by the DarkGaboon group in haste, which made it possible to identify the connection between the mentioned clusters.

During the research, we also found that all Dynamic DNS control domains of the DarkGaboon group were registered using an online batch domain registration service, frequently featured in tutorial videos on using Revenge RAT.

Malware analysis
In the attacks by the DarkGaboon group identified in our research, the payload consisted of builds protected by a crypter with encapsulated Revenge RAT samples and DLL files using RunPE methods, encrypted using the AES algorithm.

The first line of defense against detection is code obfuscation using the .NET Reactor protector with the following techniques:
control flow;
anti-ildasm;
rename;
namespace obfuscation;
mutation;
method protection;
proxy calls.

The Dynamic DNS domains of the control server and the non-standard network ports used to resolve its IP address are hardcoded into the builds modified by the crypter during compilation.

To bypass heuristic analysis, a five-minute timer is activated: after it expires, the payload extraction and decryption processes start. The Broodje_Mexicano ("Mexican sandwich") function extracts two objects encapsulated in the build (array and array2), which are byte arrays, and together with a hardcoded key and salt passes them for AES decryption to the _GetFunctions function.

The byte array "array" is an encrypted Revenge RAT sample, and "array2" is an encrypted DLL file with RunPE injection methods used to inject malicious code into legitimate Windows processes, providing extra protection from detection and privilege escalation on the infected system.

After extraction and launch, the Revenge RAT samples establish persistence on the infected system in one of the following ways: by self-replicating into the startup directory, or by self-replicating into the C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming directory and creating a LNK file in the startup directory using a PDF icon.

C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup<filename>.lnk

In both cases, Windows registry keys responsible for autostarting programs when the OS boots are modified:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Once persistence is established, the Revenge RAT samples collect information about the hardware and software using the following methods:
GetHardDiskSerialNumber (hard disk serial number);
GetAV (installed antivirus solutions);
GetCpu (processor information);
GetCamera (webcam information);
GetSystem (operating system information);
GetIp (current IP address);
GetActiveWindow (current active window).

The collected information about the infected host, encoded in Base64, is sent over a non-standard network port to the control server while awaiting commands and operator connections.

DarkGaboon uses Windows nodes located outside of Russia with a Revenge RAT control panel as command servers, managed via RDP connection with an Administrator account.

As part of our study of this cyber threat, we identified 369 unique files associated with DarkGaboon’s infrastructure, of which:
51% (189) are executable files of Revenge RAT.
33% (122) are decoy archives.
12% (43) are Microsoft Office decoy documents.
4% (15) are LNK files used to establish persistence on infected systems.

DarkGaboon demonstrates consistency in updating their file kits, releasing about 10 new malicious builds with Revenge RAT and a proportional number of decoy files each month. This “serpentine” discipline and regular “shedding of old skin” allowed the group to covertly attack Russian companies for over a year and a half without resorting to sophisticated techniques or rare malware. Moreover, since March 2024, there has been an almost twofold increase (compared to 2023) in the monthly updates of Revenge RAT builds, indicating a possible expansion of the group’s offensive arsenal and attack surface targeting Russian companies.

Attack Landscape
Almost half of all sample uploads to public file scanning services originate from Russia, which, together with other artifacts (discussed in the next section), points to a clear targeting of Russian companies by DarkGaboon. During the investigation, we identified and notified the group’s victims, including:

financial institutions;

large retail chains;

sports and tourism facilities;

service sector companies.

Artifacts

During the investigation of the DarkGaboon group’s malicious arsenal, a number of artifacts were identified that distinguish it from the general background of cyber activity involving Revenge RAT:

A space in the word “прикрепленном” (“attached”). It is believed that this typo occurred during manual text input, as online translators do not typically produce such errors.

All 43 variations of Microsoft Office lure documents were generated by making minor modifications to 4 document templates downloaded from Russian finance-oriented websites. It is likely that this technique is used to alter the hash sums of lure files and avoid detection based on repeated use of the same lures already listed in antivirus databases.

The vast majority of detected samples have Russian-language filenames related to financial reporting.

Since August 2024, DarkGaboon has been using homoglyphs in the names of malicious samples, giving them a "spotted" appearance (resembling snake skin) and making them undetectable by strict search rules that target files with purely Cyrillic names.

It is believed that the use of homoglyphs helps the group remain undetected by cyber intelligence tools. This technique was observed in the names of 84% of the Revenge RAT samples.

5. All Revenge RAT samples used by the DarkGaboon group are signed with fake X.509 certificates, most of which have Russian-language owner names. Specifically, the following are used:
terms typical of accounting reports (e.g., "Акт сверки", "Акт сверки взаиморасчетов");
transliterations of accounting-related terms (e.g., "1c Sverka", "sverka", "Buh");

names of popular financial software products such as “1С” (e.g., "1C-connect", "1c бухгалтерия");
names of Russian IT companies: “Kaspersky Lab” (AO Kaspersky Lab, Kaspersky Security), “Doctor Web” (Doctor Web Ltd.), “Yandex” (Yandex LLC), “Astra” (Astra);
names of Russian cities, especially Moscow (e.g., Moscow Z LLC, Moscow LLC, Moscow, Moskvabad City, Krasnodar);
others (e.g., Russia Buhgalter Union, Russia, Zabix, Eugene).

The icing on the cake is an X.509 certificate with a rather obscene owner name, indicating the DarkGaboon participants' knowledge of Russian obscene vocabulary.

A separate group of X.509 certificates appears to be dedicated to American cities and states (e.g., Alabama, Boston, Dakota, Detroit, Nevada) and brands (e.g., Marvel, Coca Cola). However, no signs of these certificates being used in attacks against U.S. users have been identified. It is worth noting that along with unique X.509 certificates that strongly reveal the malicious arsenal of the group, DarkGaboon also uses certificates popular in the cybercriminal environment, which are found across many malicious samples from different groups. The use of such certificates is due to the group's employment of popular crypters for obfuscating and signing malicious code.

Conclusion
Russian companies continue to be not only targets of cyber espionage but also victims of attacks by financially motivated APT groups. The DarkGaboon case demonstrates that attackers can remain undetected for over a year and a half, mimicking their environment like a viper by using publicly available malicious tools and hiding their digital footprints in the “thickets” of other criminal cyber activity.
Particularly concerning are the artifacts we have identified that clearly indicate the DarkGaboon group members have no difficulty reading and writing in Russian, surfing the Russian Internet space, and creating names typical of Russian-language documents. All this (together with the use of Russian obscene vocabulary) strongly suggests that the group members are likely native Russian speakers.
The consistent update of their offensive arsenal indicates that DarkGaboon has no intention of slowing down and will continue delivering "viper bites" to the financial departments of Russian companies. The Cyber Intelligence Department of the Positive Technologies Security Expert Center will continue to monitor the group's activity and promptly alert victims of upcoming cyberattacks.

Protection Recommendations
To protect against DarkGaboon attacks, it is recommended to:
Use licensed antivirus software with up-to-date and regularly refreshed signature databases.
Scan email attachments from untrusted and suspicious senders with antivirus tools. Be cautious if there is no prior correspondence history with the sender, the sender is not a known business partner, uses an email address with an unusual domain, emphasizes the urgency of reviewing documents, or highlights the names of government institutions or regulatory authorities.
Avoid opening password-protected archives and attached files without first scanning them with antivirus tools.
Disable the hiding of file extensions; verify the actual extensions of files: do not open files whose icon does not match the real extension; do not open files that contain multiple extensions separated by dots at the end of the name.
Regularly conduct training sessions for employees on safe email usage and countering social engineering techniques.
