Facing the constant barrage of junk ads during video watching or software downloads can instantly ruin even the best mood. Seeing various "ad-free, green, clean" cracked software versions online might seem like a blessing; but the reality could be that an even bigger pitfall is hidden within! Recently, the 360 Security Brain has detected a batch of cracked software propagating Remote Access Trojans (RATs) under the guise of "clean versions" and "ad removal," which continue to run rampant across the network.
Analysis by the 360 Security Brain revealed that the spreaders of this RAT repackaged cracked versions of popular software like Thunder Xunlei, iQIYI, and OBS Studio. During the repackaging process, they stealthily inserted a Trojan program generated using CobaltStrike. These poisoned packages are then disseminated via various blogs and cloud storage platforms, posing a significant threat to the personal privacy and financial security of vast numbers of users.
The 360 Security Brain has now implemented detection and removal support for this Trojan. Users who have recently used software such as "ThunderX-10.1.34.800_Clean_Optimized_Version" or "iQIYI_Video_Ad-Free_Setup_h.msi" are strongly advised to scan their systems immediately using 360 Safeguard.
Cracked Software Conceals Remote Access Trojan: Turning Your Computer Instantly "Dark" Upon Startup. Analysis by the 360 Security Brain found the attack method of this RAT to be extremely stealthy. Taking the cracked Thunder software as an example, after users unzip and run the "!Greenify.bat" batch script and install the cracked Thunder, the long-"lurking" Trojan program also automatically "lands" on the user's computer.
When the user opens this poisoned "Thunder," the Thunder.exe main program loads the ffmpeg.dll module, which has been tampered with by hackers. Subsequently, this malicious module executes the Trojan script payload.ps1 via PowerShell. The compromised ffmpeg.dll module, containing injected attack code, initiates the payload.ps1 script by executing the following command:
The payload.ps1 Trojan script contains a string of characters. The script performs a Base64 decode on this string, followed by an XOR decryption, ultimately obtaining a segment of shellcode to initiate the next stage of work. After the final shellcode is executed, as shown below:
This shellcode, upon execution, connects to the remote address 108.61.160.106:4445 and awaits remote control commands. This means your computer is now successfully "compromised." The remote controller can issue various commands to perform operations such as "browsing the file directory of the compromised client, taking screenshots, conducting port scans, and recording keystrokes."
So, perhaps just after installing this "cracked Thunder," before you even get a chance to download that eagerly awaited new movie, your computer might already be under the remote control of hackers. This sense of frustration is more than enough reason to deeply detest this virus!
Guangdong Netizens Suffer "Heart-Piercing Blow": 360 Security Brain Implements Full Detection and Removal. Notably, big data analysis by the 360 Security Brain shows that affected users are distributed across a wide geographical area. Among them, netizens in Guangdong have become the primary target, suffering the most, followed respectively by users in Zhejiang, Hubei, and Shandong.
In today's increasingly severe security landscape, the endless stream of diverse cyber threats is growing. RATs spread via cracked software carriers like this are far from uncommon, posing a serious danger to endpoint system security.
