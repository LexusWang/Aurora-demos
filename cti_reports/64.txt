APT-C-09 MahaGhoul Group  
Disclosure Statement The IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) appearing in this report, including but not limited to sample file MD5 hashes, domains, IPs, URLs, and email addresses related to attack events, have been redacted due to their sensitive nature. For detailed information or IOC requests, please contact the 360 Advanced Threat Response Team via email at 360zhuiri@360.cn. I. Overview The MahaGhoul Group (APT-C-09), also known as HangOver, VICEROY TIGER, The Dropping Elephant, and Patchwork, is a South Asia-based APT group active for over seven years. First exposed by Norman Security in 2013, the group intensified activities from 2015 onward despite multiple disclosures. Targeting China, Pakistan, and other Asian countries, it focuses on government agencies and scientific/educational institutions, primarily for sensitive data theft. Since 2009, the group has launched three confirmed campaigns and one suspected campaign, employing vulnerabilities including at least one 0day (CVE-2013-3906). Initial payload delivery relied on spear-phishing emails and limited watering hole attacks, while recent campaigns incorporated instant messaging tools, social networks, and phishing sites. The group targets Windows systems primarily but has expanded to Mac OS X (since 2012) and Android (since 2015). Analysis of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) indicates that APT groups rarely cease operations post-exposure; instead, they adapt tactics while maintaining persistence. China remains a primary APT target due to geopolitical factors and insufficient proactive defense measures. II. Four Campaigns 1. First Campaign (2012-2013): Targeted Pakistan and China via spear-phishing with attachments and watering holes, exploiting CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2012-0422, and CVE-2012-4792. 2. Second Campaign (2013): Focused on Pakistani intelligence/military targets using CVE-2013-3906 0day in Office documents. 3. Third Campaign (2014-2015): Reused CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158 against Pakistani targets, employing Python-based malware packed via PyInstaller/Py2Exe. 4. Fourth (Suspected) Campaign (2015-2016): Shifted focus to China using CVE-2014-4114, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2014-1761. Delivery methods expanded to instant messaging (QQ), social networks, and phishing sites. SOA record correlations and target alignment suggest continuity with earlier campaigns. III. Impact on China Geographical Distribution (July 2015-June 2016): Beijing (highest), Guangdong, and Fujian were most affected; no infections detected in Tibet, Ningxia, or Guizhou. Industry Targeting: Scientific/educational institutions (primary), followed by government and military sectors. IV. Payload Delivery 1. Spear-Phishing: Primary vector using malicious attachments (.exe/.scr) or exploit documents (e.g., CVE-2013-3906). Filenames align with social engineering themes (e.g., "Jakobson_US_China_Report.pps"). 2. Instant Messaging (QQ): MP4-lure executables (e.g., "my_birthday_celebration") delivered via repeated targeting. 3. Social Networks: Limited use of domestic platforms to distribute payloads or links. 4. Watering Hole: Atypical implementation via compromised legitimate sites (e.g., Facebook in APT-C-15 "Sphinx" campaign). V. Phishing Sites Fake NetEase mail portals (e.g., hxxp://web.com/) captured credentials via POST to attacker-controlled IPs. HTML source modifications redirected submissions to **.***..242. VI. Exploit Analysis 1. 0day Exploit (CVE-2013-3906): TIFF integer overflow in ogl.dll enabled heap spraying via Office documents, first observed in October 2013 before public disclosure. 2. Document Exploits: Heavy usage of CVE-2014-4114 (OLE) in PPT files, bypassing defenses via zlib evasion in Office 2003 formats. 3. Lures: Politically/themed documents (e.g., South China Sea disputes), fake videos ("myvideoforyou2"), and PDFs. VII. Backdoor Analysis 1. Mac OS X: OSX.Kumar variants exfiltrated files (.doc, .pdf, etc.) via HTTP to *ble.org. 2. Python Malware: Modularized tools (file exfiltration, keylogging) packed via PyInstaller/Py2Exe. 3. AutoIT RAT: Indetectables RAT-derived code with UAC bypass, Chrome credential theft, and PowerShell-based C2. 4. FakeJLI: DLL sideloading via signed Java binaries (MICROS~1.EXE) to execute jij.dll. C2 retrieved dynamically from forum posts/compromised sites. VIII. C2 Infrastructure 1. WHOIS Privacy: 97% of fourth campaign domains used privacy protection vs. 64% in first campaign. 2. IP Geolocation: Predominantly US/EU hosts, with historical overlaps between campaigns. 3. Third-Party Relay: C2 addresses embedded in forum comments (e.g., domestic BBS) or hacked sites. IX. Attribution 1. Code Links: Shared PDB paths ("Yash"/"Kanishk"), SOA records (********24@gmail.com), and Indian developer metadata (Rajinder Kumar). 2. Campaign Overlaps: Reused C2 domains (*ops.com, *rce.com) and network patterns across campaigns. 3. Motivations: State-sponsored characteristics via sustained resource investment (0days, multi-OS targeting). X. Conclusion 1. Persistent Threat: APT-C-09 continues evolving post-disclosure, reflecting APT's "Persistent" nature. 2. High Resource Commitment: 0day usage, cross-platform tools, and diversified delivery indicate nation-state backing. 3. China as Prime Target: Geopolitical relevance drives attacks on scientific/military sectors, exploiting defensive gaps. 4. Capability Gaps: Limited domestic threat detection capacity and reactive post-disclosure responses enable adversary success. 5. Security-Informatization Integration: Emphasizes unified planning under national cybersecurity strategies to mitigate APT risks.
