The phrase "Wildfires cannot consume it; spring winds revive it anew" perfectly describes the "dead yet undying" nature of botnets. On June 9th, the 360 Security Brain detected high-risk anomalous activity within the "Driver Talent" botnet. Its existing bot modules underwent large-scale updates, incorporating an "SMBv3 Exploit Module" and a "Redis Unauthorized Access Exploit Module." This aims to leverage newly exposed high-risk "worm-like" vulnerabilities to expand infection scope and compromise more computers for profit. Analysis by the 360 Security Brain reveals that the "zero-touch remote" compromise capability of the SMBv3 vulnerability (also known as SMBGhost, CVE-2020-0796) significantly boosts the propagation power of the "Driver Talent" botnet. Without preventative measures, this could trigger a new wave of botnet rampage. However, users need not overly worry: 360 Safeguard not only immediately supported patchless remediation for the SMBv3 vulnerability but also efficiently intercepts and kills "Driver Talent" botnet attacks. The "Driver Talent" botnet update represents a long-term, premeditated act of online "scavenging." 360 Security Brain monitoring data shows that foreign security researchers recently published SMBv3 zero-touch remote exploit code online. The "Driver Talent" botnet swiftly followed suit, rapidly incorporating this vulnerability into its arsenal "for its own use" to upgrade the botnet's attack potency. Based on previously disclosed vulnerability information by the 360 Security Brain, the SMBv3 vulnerability (CVE-2020-0796) is a high-risk zero-touch remote code execution flaw. It allows unauthorized control of the target without any user interaction. This means that if maliciously exploited by the "Driver Talent" botnet, the SMBv3 vulnerability could drastically enhance the botnet's "infectivity" within a short period. image001.png SMBv3 Vulnerability Attack Module 360 Security Brain monitoring data indicates that the newly added SMBv3 exploit module in the "Driver Talent" botnet is named smbghost_exec. This function downloads the SMBv3 exploit program from hxxp://d.ackng.com/smgh.bin and releases it onto the target machine. Crucially, after compromising the target machine, the SMBv3 exploit module also executes commands shown in the image below. This transforms the infected target into a node of the "Driver Talent" botnet, enabling it to launch attacks against other machines. Given that the SMBv3 vulnerability affects Windows 10 versions 1903 and above, the threat level is self-evident. image002.png Commands Executed After SMBv3 Zero-Touch Remote Vulnerability Attack Secondary Linux Attack Module Update: 360 Security Brain Thwarts Botnet's Persistent Ambitions The 360 Security Brain also detected within its monitoring data that this "Driver Talent" botnet update includes an exploit module for Redis unauthorized access vulnerabilities. This module scans vulnerable Linux servers, creates scheduled tasks on target servers, turning compromised Linux servers into new "infection sources" for the botnet. Notably, this is the second Linux server attack module update observed by the 360 Security Brain following the earlier addition of an SSH brute-force module. image003.png Redis Unauthorized Access Vulnerability Attack Module Since 2018, when the "Driver Talent" trojan infected 100,000 computers within 2 hours, shocking the internet, the "Driver Talent" botnet has never ceased its illegal online profiteering. According to 360 Security Brain monitoring data, as of now, the SMB brute-force module (including Pass the Hash attacks) and the EternalBlue vulnerability exploit module remain the most harmful attack vectors within the "Driver Talent" cryptomining botnet, responsible for the majority of infections. image004.png Overview of Infected Machines per Attack Module in the "Driver Talent" Cryptomining Botnet Vulnerabilities and exploits coexist. As new exploit code surfaces, an increasing number will be co-opted by the "Driver Talent" botnet, becoming new attack modules endangering network security. Currently, empowered by the 360 Security Brain, 360 Safeguard not only provided pioneering patchless remediation support for the SMBv3 zero-touch remote vulnerability immediately upon its disclosure but also efficiently intercepts various attack threats, including the "Driver Talent" botnet, safeguarding user network security. Finally, regarding the continuously escalating threat of the "Driver Talent" botnet, the 360 Security Brain offers the following security recommendations: 1. Download and install 360 Safeguard from weishi.360.cn to effectively intercept such exploit threats; 2. Update computer systems promptly and regularly scan for software security vulnerabilities, applying patches immediately; 3. If abnormal computer behavior is detected, use 360 Safeguard promptly for a system scan to detect and remove viruses/trojans; 4. Enhance security awareness: avoid clicking on emails, documents, or links from unknown sources, and regularly patch operating systems, IE, Flash, and other common software; 5. Enable the "Web Protection" function in 360 Safeguard to identify fraudulent webpages and block phishing sites and dangerous links, ensuring computer information security.
