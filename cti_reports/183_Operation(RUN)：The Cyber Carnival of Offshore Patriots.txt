Overview
In December 2024, we disclosed a watering hole attack affecting top sites such as CSDN[1]. The attacker group behind this was named UTG-Q-015. After the publication, this group changed their previously common tactics and began exploiting 0day and Nday vulnerabilities to infiltrate government and enterprise web sites. In March, they deployed a batch of scanning nodes to conduct brute-force attacks on government and enterprise targets. In April, we observed UTG-Q-015 conducting large-scale watering hole attacks targeting blockchain websites, digital signature backends, Bitcoin backends, GitLab backends, and other web systems, impacting some government and enterprise clients. Meanwhile, they also targeted financial personnel through IM phishing, with C2 callbacks to internal web addresses to download a three-stage payload.

Whenever "Chinese-speaking attackers" are mentioned, foreign vendors often refer to them as “CN-Nexus.” In reality, Chinese-speaking attackers are distributed across East Asia and Southeast Asia. There are East Asian outsourced groups like Operation EviLoong[2] and Operation Giant[3], who conduct high-level espionage for profit, and there are professional teams like UTG-Q-015 based in Southeast Asia providing penetration and intelligence services to Southeast Asian companies and institutions. These two types of attacker teams are hostile and even attack each other. This explains why UTG-Q-015 infiltrated multiple domestic programming forums last year—to retaliate and counterattack. On the surface, this looks like an "outsourcing war," but deeper down it reflects conflicts of ideology and political stances.

We recommend government and enterprise clients enable cloud detection features to discover unknown threats. Currently, the Tianqing product can detect and kill UTG-Q-015’s toolset.

Scanning and Brute-force Nodes
Based on Xlab data, UTG-Q-015 activated a new batch of scanning nodes in March to brute-force externally facing web servers of government and enterprises. The distribution of these nodes is as follows:

After successful brute force, they release Cobalt Strike backdoors and modified nps tunnels, then use fscan with the brute-forced credentials to attempt lateral movement. From April, these nodes began exploiting Nday vulnerabilities including CVE-2021-38647, CVE-2017-12611, CVE-2017-9805, etc.

Watering Hole Attacks on Blockchain Websites
In April, triggered by alerts from Tianqing’s "Liuhe" advanced threat defense engine, we observed victims downloading payloads from the following URLs:

URLs:

hxxps://updategoogls.cc/tools.exe

hxxps://safe-controls.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/res/tools.zip

Referer headers identified:

Referer	Website Content
https://www.ruleos.com	WEB3 development site
https://13.229.89.211	Real IP for biodao.finance, a blockchain project

Based on Qi An Xin’s Global Hawk mapping data, more than one hundred websites have been compromised and infected with malicious code.

Compromised websites mostly include Web3 homepages, Bitcoin backend login pages, e-signature management backends, GitLab login pages, etc. The injected JS code is as follows:

When victims visit these pages, phishing content is displayed to induce downloading fake update files.

UTG-Q-015 uses a brand-new lightweight .NET backdoor with command execution and file upload capabilities. Subsequent payloads are consistent with prior campaigns.

Targeted Attacks on Financial Institutions
In April, UTG-Q-015 targeted financial units by first exploiting unknown web vulnerabilities to compromise boundary servers, using them as download jump points. They then used IM phishing with bait files named like "ConfidentialXXXX.exe" delivered to personnel in the targeted units. The downloader loaded in memory contains previously compromised public domain names and internal IPs of the web boundary servers in the same units to retrieve a third-stage payload.

Attacks on Linux AI Components
UTG-Q-015 typically uses backdoors such as Xnote, Ghost, and Vshell to control Linux servers, focusing on AI-related targets in 2025.

In February, they exploited an unauthorized vulnerability in the ComfyUI-Manager plugin to deliver malicious model files[4], eventually loading Vshell. We reiterate to critical infrastructure units and partners: do not expose ComfyUI components publicly. We have observed overseas APT groups exploiting unknown ComfyUI vulnerabilities for espionage.

In April, they used CVE-2023-48022 to infiltrate domestic AI research servers, then executed related bash scripts and plugins similar to those mentioned above, ultimately loading Vshell.

Summary
Currently, all products based on Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center’s data—including the Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, Qi An Xin NGSOC, and Qi An Xin Situational Awareness—already support precise detection of these types of attacks.
