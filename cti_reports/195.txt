Ransomware New Waves Surge BalaClava and WannaGreenHat Families Compete for Prominence  
As temperatures rise across China with historical heat peaks emerging, cybercriminals are capitalizing on the heat to launch global ransomware campaigns. According to 360 Security Brain monitoring, May witnessed not only sustained high activity from the GlobeImposter, Phobos, and Crysis families but also emerging threats like BalaClava, WannaGreenHat, and RagnarLocker competing for dominance. The GlobeImposter family dethroned Phobos as the top ransomware threat with 22.85% prevalence, while Crysis climbed two spots to third place. The newly emerged BalaClava family demonstrated alarming destructive capabilities, securing a top 10 position within two months of its debut. This family employs variants like KEY0001, KEY0003, KEY0004, and KEY0005, typically deploying manual attacks after successful RDP brute-force cracking and utilizing NTRU encryption algorithms. Domestic ransomware WannaGreenHat modified file extensions to .WannaGreenCap and instructed victims to contact a specified QQ account for decryption keys. Despite including a "What is QQ" explanation for international victims, the malware was neutralized by 360 Decryption Master before widespread distribution. The RagnarLocker family adopted new propagation methods using VirtualBox virtual machines to encrypt host files or steal data, demanding ransoms between $200,000 and $600,000. Windows 7 became the primary attack target at 36.59% infection rate, while also accounting for 76.99% of brute-force attacks. MSSQL and RDP brute-force attempts showed significant increases. 360 Security Brain implemented multi-dimensional defenses, with 360 Decryption Master supporting decryption for over 320 ransomware variants. In May 2020, it added support for WannaGreenHat and Dodged families, with GandCrab showing the highest decryption volume and Stop family affecting the most users.
