Recently, the 360 Security Brain captured an APT attack named "Panda Bear" (APT-C-37). Since October 2015, the Panda Bear organization (APT-C-37) has launched organized, planned, targeted, and persistent attacks against a specific armed group. The political and religious issues surrounding this armed group have made it a target for numerous hackers and nation-states. In March 2017, the armed group's Amaq media channel issued a warning stating that the website had been compromised, and visitors were prompted to download a virus file disguised as a Flash installer. This message confirmed the armed group as the target of Panda Bear operations, with payload delivery methods including at least watering hole attacks. What is "Panda Bear"? Analysis by 360 Beacon Lab revealed that Panda Bear targets both Windows and Android platforms. We captured 32 Android attack samples and 13 Windows attack samples, involving 7 C&C domains. One primary C&C used by the group is located in a Middle Eastern country and shares the same subnet as C&Cs used by the contemporaneous "Golden Mouse" group [1]. Further comparative analysis shows strong correlations between the two groups, though each possesses unique RATs. Both are fluent in Arabic, have targeted Android and Windows platforms for years, and excel at watering hole attacks. Both employ multiple RATs, with significant overlap in usage. Both groups used C&Cs within the same subnet during overlapping time periods. Given Panda Bear's targeting of an armed group, its dual-platform attacks, and the historical context of a unique animal emblem associated with military identification in a specific Middle Eastern country—coupled with other characteristics and 360's APT naming conventions—we named this group after a character in the DOTA game: Panda Bear. Figure 1.1 Key timeline of Panda Bear attack events How does "Panda Bear" deliver payloads? The primary method is watering hole attacks. The Al Swarm News Agency website (Figure 2.1) belonged to the armed group. Like Amaq, it suffered various global attacks, changed domains multiple times, and is now offline. Panda Bear used both Amaq and Al Swarm for watering hole attacks. The Al Swarm attack involved replacing the legitimate app with a malicious one embedded with RATs. Specific download links and MD5 hashes for Android RATs are listed in Table 1. Beyond these two media site attacks, we identified other historical watering hole attacks used by the group (Table 2), including download links and MD5s for both Android and Windows RATs. 360 Security Brain monitoring shows Panda Bear's attacks impacted 11 countries, all known to host personnel affiliated with the targeted armed group. This distribution directly results from their targeted watering hole campaigns. Figure 2.2 Geographic distribution of attacks How does "Panda Bear" disguise itself? The group employs two main deception tactics: Icon Spoofing: Malicious files mimic legitimate application icons (Figure 3.1). Embedding RATs within Functional Apps: To evade detection beyond icon spoofing, RATs are injected into functional apps. For example, an app named "زوجاتالرسول" (Wives of the Prophet) displays a normal interface but conducts espionage in the background upon receiving specific broadcasts (Figure 3.2). Utilizing Multiple Android and Windows RATs The campaign employs several distinct RATs for each platform. Android: Three RATs are used: DroidJack & SpyNote: Commercially available RATs frequently traded on hacker forums, widely detected by security vendors. Panda Bear uses them directly or embeds them within legitimate apps. DroidJack management interface shown in Figure 4.1; SpyNote interface in Figure 4.2. SSLove: A previously unreported RAT unique to this campaign, undergoing multiple updates. Named SSLove due to the string "runmylove" and its use of SQL Server for C2 communication. Latest versions steal SMS, contacts, WhatsApp/Telegram data, and upload files via FTP. Used directly (e.g., the malicious Al Swarm app) or embedded. SSLove command table shown in Figure 4.3. Windows: Three RATs prevalent in the Middle East are used: njRAT (Bladabindi): Controls registry, processes, files, and logs keystrokes. Supports plugins. Panda Bear typically encapsulates it within a heavily obfuscated C# loader that executes njRAT in memory (e.g., the fake Flash Player from the Amaq attack). Sample shown in Figure 4.4. H-Worm (Houdini Worm): A VBS-based RAT. The group uses an obfuscated variant; deobfuscation reveals unchanged command functionality. Obfuscated code snippet in Figure 4.5; command-function mapping in Table 3. Fkn0wned: A VB.NET RAT. An early version is used here, acting primarily as a downloader responding only to "DOWNLOAD" commands; DDoS functionality is inactive. Configuration and response code shown in Figure 4.6.
