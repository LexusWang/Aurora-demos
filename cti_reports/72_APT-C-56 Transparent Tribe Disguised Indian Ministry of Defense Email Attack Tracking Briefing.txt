APT-C-56 Transparent Tribe Disguised Indian Ministry of Defense Email Attack Tracking Briefing
APT-C-56 Transparent Tribe (alias APT36, ProjectM, C-Major), a South Asia-linked APT group, has long conducted targeted attacks against political and military entities in neighboring countries and regions (particularly India). The group developed its exclusive CrimsonRAT malware and was previously found spreading USB worms extensively. It persistently targets Indian government agencies, public sectors, and various industries including healthcare, power, finance, and manufacturing for cyber espionage. Recently, 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute discovered and captured documents used by Transparent Tribe to attack the Indian Ministry of Defense, with the malicious documents ultimately deploying CrimsonRAT. The group previously attempted to attack the Indian Ministry of Defense, and the newly captured documents exhibit nearly identical content and attack flow compared to previous campaigns, still delivering the same RAT with only minor document modifications. It remains uncertain whether these are test documents or previously undetected IoCs from prior attacks. The malicious document disguises itself as a data spreadsheet to trick targets into opening it. The document contains macro code that automatically executes upon enabling macros, masquerading as an email from the Ministry of Defense's Defense Security Corps and Secretariat (LS) regarding email account migration requiring forwarding. This confirms the document's targeting of the Indian Ministry of Defense. The delivered RAT is CrimsonRAT, which Transparent Tribe has maintained since its first disclosure in 2016. This .NET-based proprietary RAT remains the group's primary cyber espionage tool, supporting expandable modules like keyloggers and USB worms. CrimsonRAT contains server components for managing infected machines, with two distinct versions compiled in 2017, 2018, and 2019, both maintained until at least 2020. The final process launches RAT with following control codes: Enumerate processes (getavs), Upload GIF (thumb), Enumerate processes (procl), Set autostart (putsrt), Download file (dowf), Set screenshot (scrsz), Get file attributes (filsz), View screenshot (cdcrgn, cscrgn, csdcrgn), Stop screenshot (stops), Desktop screenshot (scren), Get disk info (dirs), Parameter initialization (cnls), Delete file (delt), Get file info (afile), Delete user (udlt), Search file (listf), Get user info (info), Execute file (runf), Move file (file).
