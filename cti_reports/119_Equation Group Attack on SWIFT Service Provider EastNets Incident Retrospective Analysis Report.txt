Equation Group Attack on SWIFT Service Provider EastNets Incident Retrospective Analysis Report  
Cyberspace threat actors are the source of cyber attack activities with varying purposes motivations and distinct hierarchical differences in capabilities. Antiy categorizes cyberspace threat actors into seven tiers based on operational motives attack capabilities and resource control: amateur hackers black industry organizations cybercrime groups or hacker collectives cyberterrorist organizations general-capacity nation-state/regional actors advanced-capacity nation-state/regional actors and ultra-high-capacity nation-state/regional actors (see Appendix I). Ultra-high-capacity nation-state/regional actors also known as ultra-high-capacity cyberspace threat actors possess tightly organized structures massive support engineering systems systematic attack arsenals and resources enabling the most covert and lethal cyber operations. Antiy has termed such attacks A2PT (Advanced Advanced Persistent Threat). The Equation Group exemplifies this category of ultra-high-capacity cyberspace threat actors. First disclosed by Kaspersky Lab in February 2015 it was reported to have been active for nearly two decades potentially ranking among the most sophisticated APT groups[1]. Antiy has persistently tracked Equation Group's activities releasing four analytical reports since March 2015: "Trojan Modifying HDD Firmware: Exploring Equation Group's Attack Components"[2] analyzing its malware modules and firmware-based persistence mechanisms; "Analysis of Encryption Techniques in Equation Components"[3] revealing its resource encryption methods; "From 'Equation' to 'Equations': Analysis of Equation Group's Cross-Platform Malware Capabilities"[4] exposing its cross-OS payloads including exclusive samples targeting Solaris and Linux; and "Equation Group's Equation DRUG Platform Analysis"[5] piecing together its modularized atomic operation framework. Our primary limitation remains the malware-centric analysis perspective constrained by post-compromise forensic data and threat intelligence-expanded sample associations. Existing industry analyses whether on Equation Group or other ultra-high-capacity threats like Stuxnet[6] Flame[7] and Duqu[8] predominantly focus on vulnerability principles sample reverse-engineering and attack mechanism reconstructions. While valuable these efforts cannot compensate for defenders' insufficient understanding of TTPs (Tactics Techniques and Procedures) employed by ultra-high-capacity actors. Equation Group and similar entities operate through comprehensive frameworks involving large-scale engineering systems standardized weapon portfolios and meticulously organized operations emphasizing stealth and anti-attribution making their intrusion lifecycle (initial access lateral movement persistence data exfiltration) exceptionally difficult to detect. Post-Snowden disclosures provided deeper insights into ultra-high-capacity actors' engineering systems. The 2017 Shadow Brokers leak exposed numerous attack tools. While lower-tier threat actors rapidly weaponized these exploits (e.g., WannaCry outbreak) they also offered unprecedented resources for reconstructing ultra-high-capacity attack frameworks. On April 14 2017 Shadow Brokers released a "SWIFT" folder detailing Equation Group's two financial sector campaigns: "JEEPFLEA_MARKET" (July 2012-September 2013) targeting Middle East's largest SWIFT service provider EastNets compromising thousands of employee accounts host information credentials and admin accounts across Belgium Jordan Egypt and UAE; and "JEEPFLEA_POWDER" targeting EastNets' Latin American/Caribbean partner BCG (Business Computer Group) which ultimately failed. Combining Antiy CERT's long-term Equation Group research with leaked data we reconstructed the EastNets attack chain: a meticulously orchestrated operation by ultra-high-capacity actors targeting financial infrastructure leveraging global jump servers exploiting 0days to bypass dual-layer security devices implanting persistent backdoors mapping internal networks via credential theft and using Eternal-family exploits to compromise management servers SAA application servers while deploying kernel-level rootkits for remote control via sophisticated C2 platforms ultimately exfiltrating critical database information through SQL scripts. This report adopts situational awareness methodologies to deconstruct ultra-high-capacity threat frameworks providing critical infrastructure operators with defensive reference models. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) established in May 1973 by 239 banks from 15 countries operates the global financial messaging network facilitating secure standardized transactions among 11000+ institutions across 200+ regions by 2015. EastNets the Middle East's premier SWIFT Service Bureau serving 750+ clients including major international financial institutions offers SWIFT connectivity compliance solutions and anti-money laundering services. Equation Group's attack targeted EastNets' segmented network environment comprising VPN firewalls enterprise firewalls management servers application servers SAA servers and database servers. Despite layered defenses including access controls enterprise firewalls and endpoint protection the network succumbed to advanced attacks. Compromised assets included: Network security devices: Over 10 Cisco/Juniper firewalls (Table 2-1) exploited via CVE-2015-7755 CVE-2016-6366/6367 Management servers: Two Windows Server 2008 systems (Table 2-2) breached via Eternal-family exploits Application servers: Four servers including FTP/Exchange systems (Table 2-3) SAA servers: Ten SWIFT Alliance Access servers (Table 2-4) with 9 compromised Stolen assets: 300+ device credentials bank account data transaction records (Table 2-5) Attack tools spanned three categories: 1. Exploitation: FuzzBunch platform hosting 17+ exploits including EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0143-0148) EternalRomance (CVE-2017-0143) and ExplodingCan (CVE-2017-7269) 2. Persistence: Firmware-level implants like FEEDTROUGH (Juniper) JETPLOW/SCREAMINGPLOW (Cisco) and rootkits DoublePulsar/DarkPulsar 3. C2: Modular platforms like DanderSpritz featuring memory-resident payloads trigger-based activation and evasion mechanisms The attack employed six global jump servers (Table 4-1) across Kazakhstan Japan Taiwan and Germany leveraging multiple intrusion paths: 1. Juniper VPN firewall compromise via CVE-2015-7755 → FEEDTROUGH/ZESTYLEAK/BARGLEE implants 2. Cisco firewall breaches via EPICBANANA/EXTRABACON → JETPLOW/SCREAMINGPLOW/BANANAGLEE 3. Eternal exploits against management servers → DoublePulsar/DarkPulsar → DanderSpritz deployment 4. Lateral movement to SAA servers → SQL script execution (initial_oracle_exploit.sql swift_msg_queries_all.sql) for database exfiltration Mapping to NSA/CSS Cyber Threat Framework V2 the campaign involved 15 objectives and 47 actions across six stages: reconnaissance environmental shaping delivery exploitation execution internal recon credential access lateral movement exfiltration C2 and evasion. Key defensive recommendations: 1. Adopt threat framework-based defense planning 2. Assume breach mentality ("assume adversaries are already inside") 3. Implement multi-layered detection (network traffic analysis endpoint behavioral monitoring) 4. Enforce credential hygiene and access controls 5. Develop tactical situational awareness systems 6. Establish operationalized security processes 7. Invest in threat hunting capabilities This analysis underscores that while ultra-high-capacity threats pose significant challenges they are not undefeatable. The failed "JEEPFLEA_POWDER" campaign against BCG demonstrates effective defenses are achievable through systematic preparation and sustained investment in cybersecurity capabilities.
