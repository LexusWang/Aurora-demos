Since the beginning of 2020 when Antiy CERT first disclosed the “Young Elephant” group, the scale and volume of its attack activities have multiplied annually. Its attack methods and resources have progressively diversified, and its target scope has expanded from initially only South Asia to broader regions. Compared to the immature “Young Elephant” we defined earlier, the group has now grown into the most active and mature threat actor in the South Asian region. This report summarizes the “Young Elephant” group’s attack activities, tactics, and tools observed from 2020 to the present.

Overview
On January 25, 2020, Antiy Security Research and Emergency Response Center (Antiy CERT) published the report “Operation Origami: Cyber Attacks Targeting Military and Government Entities in Multiple South Asian Countries” [1]. It disclosed large-scale targeted cyberattacks against government, military, and defense entities in South Asian countries since 2017. Due to the relative independence of its attack resources and techniques, it is speculated to be an independently operating attack team. Antiy CERT assigned the name “Young Elephant” to this advanced threat group.

The Young Elephant group is suspected to originate from India. Since its exposure, its attack deployment behavior and the number of compromised targets have continued to grow rapidly. Compared to its earlier, unorganized exploratory attempts, the group now has developed several relatively fixed toolsets that can be deployed on new attack nodes. Moreover, its targets have expanded from initially only South Asia to also include locations within China. This trend is similar to the “White Elephant” group’s shift of focus from South Asia to China after 2013.

The timeline below summarizes the first appearance dates of various attack vectors used by the Young Elephant group and the cumulative number of samples, showing that most techniques remain actively updated today except for some rare self-extracting bait files.

Over the past five years, typical historic attack activities of the group include:

Since mid-2017, delivering targeted self-extracting attack files to military and government institutions in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and other countries.

Since late 2017, delivering Office document attack files to educational and government entities in Pakistan, Nepal, and others.

Since late 2018, delivering targeted air-gapped network penetration trojans to Pakistan’s military.

Since mid-2019, launching large-scale targeted phishing website attacks against multiple South Asian countries.

Since late 2019, delivering LNK file attack payloads to military entities in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Since late 2020, delivering malicious Android trojans targeting political-related objectives in Nepal and others.

Since mid-2021, conducting targeted intelligence-stealing attacks against related institutions in China.

This report provides a summary of the Young Elephant group’s attack activities, tactics, and tools discovered since 2020. The overall characteristics of these activities can be briefly summarized as follows:

Attack Activity Analysis
Since Antiy’s disclosure of the group in January 2020 via the Operation Origami report [1], both new and old attack nodes and samples of the Young Elephant group have continued to be monitored. This includes multiple phishing website attacks impersonating official email systems of Nepal’s military, police, and government, as well as subsequent attacks involving stolen email accounts used to send HTA downloaders, malicious macro documents, backdoor trojans, and data-stealing components.

Using Antiy Cyber Brain Threat Intelligence Analysis Subsystem and Sample Analysis Subsystem for expanded correlation analysis, we comprehensively linked related attack payloads. In early 2020, Young Elephant attacked Sri Lanka and Maldives using shortcut files pointing to malicious HTA script URLs. Antiy discovered the group not only compromises traditional host nodes but also smart terminal nodes; in August 2020, they attacked Nepal with a malicious Android app disguised as a public opinion poll related to the India-Nepal territorial dispute.

The attacker domains include both self-registered and free dynamic domains, all mimicking official domains of government institutions and state enterprises in Nepal, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Pakistan:

2.1 Phishing Website Attacks
Table 2-2 Phishing Activity Characteristics

Attribute	Description
Attack Purpose	Account credential theft, intelligence gathering, secondary pivoting attacks
Group Origin	India
Attack Methods	Spear-phishing emails, phishing websites
Attack Period	Since October 2020 to present
Attack Targets	Nepal government, military, police departments

The attackers mainly create phishing websites impersonating email systems of Nepal’s military, police, and government departments (e.g., Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, National Information Technology Center, Prime Minister’s Office and Council of Ministers). The goal is to steal email account credentials to prepare for follow-up attacks.

Statistics show two main types of phishing websites:

Direct Display Type: Victims visiting the phishing link see a fake email system login page directly. After entering credentials, the phishing site sends the information to its backend and then redirects the victim to the legitimate official email system website.

Bait Display Type: Victims first see a bait webpage embedded with PDFs or images related to the impersonated organization, then after a few seconds the site redirects to the fake login page. Once credentials are entered, they are sent to the phishing backend, and the victim is redirected back to the bait page.

Most embedded resources (PDFs, images) are stored locally in the phishing page directory:

Some cases embed official news pages or document links:

2.2 Malicious LNK Attacks
Young Elephant uses social engineering to craft LNK filenames and attack via malicious links.

Table 2-3 Associated LNK Sample Types

Correlation analysis on Command Centre.png.lnk via Antiy sample platform found related files MNDF.jpg and MNDF Male Area Command Centre.pdf (MNDF stands for Maldives National Defence Force). Analysis confirms these are bait files packaged with the LNK sample:

2.3 Malicious Android Applications
The Young Elephant group launched attacks against Nepal using malicious Android applications around August 2020 and other periods.

VT Detection Result	2/63

The malicious Android app disguised itself as a public opinion poll app related to the India-Nepal territorial dispute. After the victim installed and opened the app, it requested system permissions. Once granted, it leveraged AccessibilityService (an accessibility service designed by Google to help disabled users operate phones more easily) to monitor the victim’s phone. The app captured and sent data such as the phone’s IP address, current timestamp, and event types (e.g., text input, control clicks, button presses) back to the C2 server. Given that many Android samples communicating with this C2 are bundled with Metasploit modules, it is possible that this opinion poll app was also bundled with a Metasploit remote control Trojan before deployment.

In addition to opening multiple control ports for Android malware, the attacker also set up a chat tool service seemingly for their own use:

2.4 Malicious Macro Document Deployment
The Young Elephant group uses Office documents with macro viruses, employing filename social engineering to deceive targets.

Table 2-5 Malicious Macro Document Sample

Attribute	Details
Virus Name	Trojan[Downloader]/MSOffice.Agent.ccd
Original Filename	List of Nomination of the Candidates1.xltm

Last Modified Time	2021-07-28 09:46:52Z
Creator	None
Last Modifier	None
VT Detection Result	35/63

The malicious document named "List of Nomination of the Candidates1.xltm" (translated as “Candidates Nomination List 1.xltm”) has a last modification date of July 28, 2021. The document body is blank with no social engineering content. However, since the sample was distributed in Nepal, it is speculated that the filename hints at news related to the Nepal parliamentary election at that time.

When the victim enables the macro, it first creates a WindowsSecurity.zip file in the host’s %appdata% directory and extracts embedded data from the UserForm1 form into that ZIP file.

Next, the macro drops invisible.vbs into the host’s startup directory. This VBScript is used to launch the follow-up a.bat and invisible1.vbs files released by the macro.

Then, the macro drops a.bat and invisible1.vbs. The purpose of invisible1.vbs is to extract WindowsSecurity.exe from WindowsSecurity.zip to the current directory, while a.bat deletes invisible.vbs and creates a scheduled task to run WindowsSecurity.exe every two minutes.

Finally, the macro triggers a fake error popup saying "Microsoft Office Excel: This Version isn't Compatible with This file.", vbCritical, "Microsoft Error" to confuse the victim by masquerading as an Office software error.

2.5 Use of Downloader Components
The Young Elephant group primarily employs malicious shortcuts to execute remote HTA script files. The HTA script’s main functions are to download decoy files and subsequent malicious payloads, then establish persistence of the payloads by creating scheduled tasks.

Additionally, the attackers obfuscate the script by converting characters into ASCII codes to evade antivirus detection.

2.6 Use of Comprehensive Data-Stealing Components
The Young Elephant group uses Python-written trojans to steal various document files, browser cached passwords, and other host system environment information.

The early data-stealing trojan had relatively simple functionality. It used third-party Python libraries PyPDF2, PDFMiner, and Docx to parse Docx and PDF files on the host machine, extract key data, and then send Base64-encoded data to the attacker’s Gmail account.

Also, some unused function definitions in the code indicate the trojan was under active development at the time.

Later, after improvements by the attackers, the trojan’s code structure and capabilities were enhanced. It could steal stored Chrome browser website account credentials, as well as files of types txt, docx, pdf, xlsx, pptx, snt, jpg, png located in Desktop, Downloads, and Documents directories.

2.7 Use of Keylogger Components
The Young Elephant group employs related trojan components to capture keystroke sequences on compromised hosts.

Table 2-10 Python Keylogger Trojan Sample

This trojan is a modified version of an open-source Keylogger script [2] from GitHub. It uses the third-party Python library pynput to implement keylogging on the host machine. After running, the trojan sends the captured keystroke logs to the attacker’s Gmail account every 30 seconds. It also copies itself into the startup directory and renames itself as “Windows system.exe” to maintain persistence.

2.8 SHELL Backdoor Components
The Young Elephant group uses C++-written SHELL trojans to achieve remote control connections. Early versions of the C++ trojan had very limited functionality, only able to execute CMD commands and download subsequent payloads. In later improved versions, the attackers added features such as sandbox/virtual machine detection, stolen data exfiltration, file downloading, and sleep for a specified time. Additionally, attackers implemented reverse shells using the ICMP protocol and used the legitimate third-party service Telegram Bot to exfiltrate stolen information to a self-built Telegram chat.

Next, a detailed analysis of different versions of the C++ trojan follows:

2.8.1 Early Version
The early version of the trojan was very simple, capable only of executing CMD commands and downloading follow-up payloads. The attackers encoded strings such as C2 domain names, URLs, and CMD commands in Base64 to evade antivirus detection.

Table 2-11 Early Version of C++ Trojan Sample

Attribute	Details
Virus Name	Backdoor/Win32.Agent.myucfu
Original Filename	host.exe
MD5	FC2221F653E***************503B01
Processor Arch.	AMD AMD64
File Size	285,184 bytes
File Format	BinExecute/Microsoft.EXE[:X86]
Timestamp	2021-03-22 10:43:24
Compile Language	Microsoft Visual C/C++
VT Detection Result	34/70

After running, the trojan continuously loops, sending requests to the C2 server to fetch commands. When receiving commands from the C2 server, it executes them through CMD; otherwise, it exits the current loop and sends a new request for commands. If the received command is “exit,” the trojan terminates itself.

After 20 loops, the trojan downloads the follow-up payload from a hardcoded URL, saving it as filename.txt in the Temp directory.

Once downloaded, the trojan executes a decoded CMD command that uses the system tool certutil to decode filename.txt into WindowsUpdate.exe, then creates a scheduled task to run WindowsUpdate.exe daily at 11 AM for persistence.

2.8.2 Telegram Version
Table 2-12 Telegram Version of C++ Trojan Sample

Attribute	Details
Virus Name	Trojan/Generic.ASMalwS.3395B44

Compile Language	Microsoft Visual C/C++ (-)
VT Detection Result	50/69

The Telegram version trojan adds the following features on top of the early version:

Virtual Machine and Sandbox Evasion:
The trojan checks if it is running inside a VM or sandbox by querying host logical processor count, system memory size, mouse pointer movement distance, and system uptime.

Data Exfiltration via Legitimate Service:
Attackers use a self-built Telegram Bot to send stolen data back to a Telegram chat. Data is Base64-encoded before transmission. If the data length exceeds 4096 characters, the trojan splits it into multiple segments. It appends the string “END_OF_FILE” to mark the end of transmission.

The URL format used is:
https[:]//api.telegram.org//sendMessage?chat_id=-&text=<Base64_encoded_data> OR <END_OF_FILE>

Persistence:
The trojan copies itself to the current directory as “WindowsSecurity.exe” and creates a scheduled task to run this executable daily at 11 AM.

Command Transmission via Text File:
The attacker writes commands in a text file tele.txt on the C2 server. The trojan fetches commands from this file and executes them. Executable commands include:

Download Function:
The trojan downloads files from URLs written in tele.txt into the host’s Temp directory.

CMD Command Execution:
The trojan executes CMD commands written in tele.txt. After execution, it closes the CMD window and sends the command output back to the attacker’s Telegram chat.

Sleep Function:
The attacker specifies sleep duration (in 3,600,000 ms = 1 hour units) in tele.txt. The trojan sleeps accordingly after fetching the command.

2.8.3 ICMP Version

In July, Antiy discovered a C++ reverse shell trojan using the ICMP protocol. This version mainly uses ICMP to implement a reverse shell, helping evade firewall detection.

Table 2-13 C++ Trojan ICMP Version Sample

Attribute	Details
Virus Name	Trojan/Generic.ASMalwS.348CACD

Timestamp	2021-07-06 09:56:09+00:00
Compile Language	Microsoft Visual C/C++ (-)
VT Detection Result	42/70

Like the Telegram version, this trojan determines if it is running in a VM or sandbox by checking the host’s logical processor count, RAM size, mouse pointer movement distance, and system uptime. Once confirmed that it is not in a VM or sandbox, it uses the ICMP protocol to implement a reverse shell.

2.8.4 Latest Version

In the latest version, the core functionality remains largely unchanged. However, attackers abandoned the use of Telegram Bot for data exfiltration, opting instead to transmit encrypted data via URL parameters. The exfiltrated data is stored in the Apache access log (access.log) on the C2 server. Attackers use accompanying Python backend scripts to read, filter, and decrypt the access logs and also issue commands.

Table 2-14 Latest Version of C++ Trojan Sample

Attribute	Details
Virus Name	Trojan/Generic.ASMalwS.3395B44

VT Detection Result	20/68

Compared to previous versions, the latest version uses multiple C2 domains as backups to ensure stable communications. When connecting to a C2 server, the trojan randomly picks one domain; if it fails, it tries another.

Data exfiltration is done via URL parameters. The trojan encrypts all outgoing data using two layers of Base64 encoding plus the "NPA" character key. It also encrypts the host machine’s hostname in the same manner to create a unique identifier. The URL format for exfiltration is:

http[:]///id=<double Base64 + key encrypted hostname>/session=0?/value=<double Base64 + key encrypted data>/return=True

On the C2 backend, attackers use Python scripts to create directories named after the unique identifiers and place a d.txt text file inside each directory. This d.txt file contains commands issued by attackers. The trojan reads commands from this file and executes them.

If the trojan cannot find commands in the expected directory, it uses a fallback: it reads commands from the d.txt file under the @/@/h31l0 directory on the C2 server.

Attackers use the backend Python scripts to read, filter, and decrypt the Apache access logs (access.log) to obtain the victim’s transmitted data.

Attackers can issue commands to specific hosts identified by the unique identifier. Commands are written in the respective directory’s d.txt file. Commands in the latest Python backend are encrypted using Base64 plus the “APN” key.

Attribution Correlation

Antiy CERT conducted correlation and mapping of the attacker’s payloads, used C2 infrastructure, and other attack resources. A partial correlation diagram is shown below:

The Young Elephant attackers uploaded their self-developed trojans to publicly accessible international security resources to test their trojan’s ability to evade antivirus detection. However, this also exposed their location. Through resource retrieval, at least one sample uploader was identified from Delhi, India. Between 2020-11-23 and 2020-11-24, this uploader submitted eight testing malicious files. These test files share high code similarity with known Young Elephant samples.

Through analysis, Antiy CERT found many similarities between this attack campaign and the Young Elephant group in terms of targets, tactics, lures, and tools. The key similarities are:

Both target heavily overlap, focusing on countries surrounding India such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

The tactics, lure types, and tools closely match those disclosed in Antiy’s report “Operation Origami: Cyber Attacks Targeting Military and Government Agencies in South Asia” [1]. These include malicious shortcuts, malicious macro documents, malicious HTA scripts, Go language trojans, self-developed Python trojans, and self-developed C++ trojans. Both campaigns’ Python data-stealing trojans exfiltrate data to self-created Gmail accounts.

The domain naming conventions are very similar. Both mimic official domains of government agencies and state-owned enterprises in Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, etc. Both also favor dynamic domain services provided by US-based No-IP, such as hopto.org, myftp.org, servehttp.com, sytes.net, etc.

Defense Recommendations and Guidance for Enhancing Defense Capability Mapping
5.1 Capability Improvement Guidelines Based on Antian Defense Framework
Antian adheres to incorporating concepts such as the kill chain and ATT&CK threat framework. Through continuous tracking, comprehensive automated analysis, and extraction of attack techniques, Antian is progressively realizing knowledge graph-based operations for security threats, continuously driving product capability improvements, and forming formalized evaluation and cognitive capabilities for threats.

At the same time, Antian insists on bringing defense capabilities into a formal evaluation and operation track. Based on over 20 years of frontline threat confrontation experience, and absorbing and partially referencing security concepts such as the NIST CSF framework, SHIELD active defense framework, and D3FEND knowledge graph, Antian proposed the Antian Defense Technology Framework, with special emphasis on the "shaping" phase. It leverages the initiative advantage of builders and operators, strengthens defense in depth, constructs deception environments, and synchronizes the planning, construction, and usage of security protection measures with critical information infrastructure.

The current version of the Antian Defense Technology Framework is a draft, and we will continue to improve and update it. The following figure shows the checklist of concerns based on the Antian Defense Framework for the present attack activities:

5.2 Security Protection Construction Checklist
5.2.1 Capability System Construction

For the Young Elephant attack group, based on the Antian Defense Framework checklist, organizations should strengthen defense capability construction, build systematic threat confrontation capabilities, enhance personnel security awareness training, and improve practical security operation capabilities. Based on the guidance from the protection framework focus points, specific defense recommendations include:

5.2.1.1 Construction and Operation Suggestions

(1) Shape a deception environment against phishing attacks by configuring highly deceptive honeypot mailbox addresses in the organization’s email system to trap malicious phishing emails and increase the analysis cost for targeted attackers. This can be done using the Antian Zhuying Threat Analysis System (email edition) to analyze mailbox receipt. Place bait links or pages in hidden locations on the official website that normal users won’t click, to trap malicious crawling behavior and increase the judgment cost for targeted attackers.

(2) Enhance endpoint effective defense against phishing attacks, using products like the Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System product family to improve malicious code detection and defense capability. Alert on malicious attachments and links in emails, isolate suspicious files, and perform in-depth analysis in the isolated environment.

(3) Strengthen unified endpoint defense capability and network security management basics, establish reject access policies for significant risk hazards, block risky outbound connections, and set up blacklists and whitelists to ensure system environment security. Monitor user behavior and analyze network activity to prevent attackers from using legitimate web services for C2 communication. Harden system configurations and strengthen baseline protection. These tasks can be manually completed by experienced network administrators or uniformly managed and batch executed using Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System.

(4) Further strengthen network environment control capabilities to enhance proactive active defense. During daily traffic monitoring, watch for traffic indicating automated data collection to avoid attackers using scripts for automated search and data exfiltration. Monitor for configuration database data collection attempts to prevent attackers from stealing credentials. Monitor web service anomalies, report promptly, and retain traffic logs. These tasks can be completed using Antian Tanhai Threat Detection System.

(5) Improve the operation level of defense technical measures: Form a closed-loop process of planning, execution, inspection, and improvement (PDCA cycle) to continuously drive security capability building; form a closed-loop process of observation, orientation, decision, and action (OODA loop) to continually promote the development, deployment, and operation of technical measures. Pursue a cycle faster than the attacker, guided by rapid response and collaborative linkage goals, to establish a faster response and handling closed-loop. These tasks can be supported by the Antian Tactical Situational Awareness Platform.

5.2.1.2 Incident Handling Suggestions

(1) Closely monitor network connection behaviors, promptly understand and discover detailed information about the current environment, block lateral movement timely, and handle incidents promptly. These tasks can be coordinated by Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System, Bufeng Honeypot System, Tanhai Threat Detection System, and Zhengguan Firewall product linkage mechanisms.

(2) Conduct comprehensive and thorough analysis of suspected payloads in an isolated environment, produce private threat intelligence, and issue security alerts within the organization to prevent malicious samples from landing and spreading widely. Analysis work can be carried by Antian Zhuying Threat Analysis System, with intelligence output linked to Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System.

(3) Based on the incident response results, reinforce important systems’ configurations by denying access to registered behaviors; block unnecessary startup items and modifications; adjust and strengthen access control policies, restrict file and directory permissions, and protect critical folders using file system access controls; adjust and strengthen privilege control policies to ensure users only have minimum necessary permissions. These tasks can be managed through Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System's grouped security policy management.

(4) Timely install updates and patches on endpoints to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities; regularly scan systems with security software and keep libraries updated. These tasks can be managed through Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System for unified patch distribution, scheduled scanning, and updating.

(5) Manage access control between servers and endpoints; configure IP, protocols, and ports for server remote desktop access, and isolate servers from endpoints as much as possible. These configurations can be set using Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System’s distributed host firewall.

(6) Based on detailed incident review and analysis, further shape highly realistic virtual assets and high-fidelity network/user behaviors to enhance deception against attackers and create a favorable environment to protect real assets. These tasks can be carried out by Antian Bufeng Honeypot System and Antian Zhijia Endpoint Defense System’s host deception defense features.

5.2.2 Personnel Awareness Improvement

Because phishing attacks involve extensive social engineering techniques and may be specially designed, beyond improving security capabilities and operations, personnel awareness enhancement is critical:

(1) Value and cultivate employees’ cybersecurity awareness; avoid publicly exposing unnecessary mailbox information to reduce the attack surface. If mailbox info must be posted, use human-readable but machine-unfriendly formats such as uploading mailbox images, replacing '@' with '#' characters, or inserting spaces in domain suffixes to prevent automated crawling.

(2) Strengthen targeted phishing attack security drills for staff, simulate phishing scenarios to test employee awareness, generate special reports, verify employee security literacy and correctness of incident handling procedures.

Antian security services can provide relevant IT awareness training and adversary simulation evaluation for organizations.

Conclusion
Since Antian first disclosed the "Young Elephant" group in early 2020, the scale and quantity of their attacks have grown exponentially year over year. Their attack techniques and resources have become increasingly sophisticated, and targets have expanded from initial South Asia to more regions. Compared to the immature "Young Elephant" defined earlier, this group has become the most active and mature attacker in South Asia, posing a significant cybersecurity threat in South Asia and the entire Asia-Pacific region. Based on attack frequency, it is already trending to replace the related White Elephant and Bitter Elephant groups, likely becoming the main attacking group in South Asia requiring focused tracking and attention.

Currently, the observed attack payload toolset is not very systematic, with a relatively chaotic technology stack, heavily relying on social engineering skills. There is no sign of 0-day vulnerability exploitation capabilities, and even little use of known vulnerabilities. However, this does not imply low success rates. These attacks reflect the real weak defense levels and poor personnel security awareness of the victims. This aligns with our consistent view that the key element of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is "P" (persistence), which reflects the attacker’s intention and will and is decisive in APT judgment. "A" (advanced) is relative; attackers do not need absolutely "advanced" techniques, only to create a "positional advantage" or exploit defender vulnerabilities to succeed. Frequent success indicates the real cybersecurity risks faced by South Asian and other developing countries.

South Asia is one of the cradles of world civilization, with a historically advanced level of agriculture, handicrafts, and culture. However, long-term colonial invasions interrupted this civilization and caused economic stagnation, making South Asia one of the poorest regions. Post-WWII liberation movements, Western colonial "divide and rule" policies exacerbated ethnic and religious conflicts, leading to complex geopolitical issues from independence onwards. The traditional geopolitics and cyberspace problems seen today in South Asia are a cumulative reflection of these historical legacies layered with ethnic, religious, and sectarian complexities. Countries affected by the Young Elephant group have relatively underdeveloped economies and weak informatization and cybersecurity capabilities, providing opportunities for attackers. Still, like other nations, they have the right to defend their sovereignty, security, and development interests, both physically and in cyberspace.
