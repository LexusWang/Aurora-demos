APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) is an APT group suspected to originate from South America, primarily targeting entities within Colombia and other South American regions like Ecuador and Panama. Since its discovery in 2018, the group has persistently launched targeted attacks against Colombian government departments, financial and insurance sectors, large corporations, and similar entities. Recently, APT-C-36 frequently employs spear-phishing attacks using PDF files as an entry point, luring users to click malicious links within the documents to download RAR compressed archives. Most archives require a password (typically a 4-digit numeric code) for extraction. Upon decompression, a VBS script disguised as a PDF filename is revealed. When executed by the user, this VBS script initiates a complex, multi-stage fileless attack chain. The final payload is an obfuscated AsyncRAT or NjRAT trojan, incorporating code to bypass AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) mechanisms, indicating the group's continuous optimization of its attack arsenal. APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) has long targeted Colombia and neighboring nations, hosting portions of its malicious code on public service platforms like paste.ee and mail servers to conceal attack traces. To counter evolving security defenses, the group heavily modifies and obfuscates various open-source RATs (such as NjRAT and SyncRAT) for different scenarios. The trojans used in these attacks are obfuscated using SmartAssembly, and some payloads include AMSI bypass code, demonstrating the group's ongoing efforts to update the functionality and form of its malware, showcasing functional and modular characteristics. Furthermore, the malicious code and C2 servers disclosed in this report represent only the latest weapons used in part of APT-C-36's attack campaigns. We will continue to monitor the group's activities closely.
