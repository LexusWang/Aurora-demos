Background: What is OceanLotus?
"OceanLotus" (also known as APT-TOCS, APT32, OceanLotus) is considered an APT attack group originating from a certain country in the Indochina Peninsula. Active since 2012, it has continuously targeted sensitive Chinese entities and is one of the most active APT groups attacking mainland China in recent years.

Antian and other security vendors have previously released multiple analysis reports on OceanLotus, mainly focusing on PC platforms. The attack methods are often spear-phishing and phishing attacks, with relatively few mobile attacks. However, with the development of mobile internet, on one hand, people’s phones are increasingly dual-purpose, containing both personal privacy and social attributes; on the other hand, smartphone wireless communication can bypass internal security monitoring devices. Therefore, attacks targeting mobile platforms have become an important part of the overall attack chain. Below, Antian Mobile Security presents a detailed analysis based on a mobile attack incident that occurred in China.

Table 1. Basic Information of Typical Samples

The app disguises itself as a legitimate application, hides its icon after running, releases malicious sub-packages in the background, and receives remote control commands. It steals users’ SMS, contacts, call logs, geolocation, browser history, and other private information; downloads APKs without authorization; takes photos and records audio; and uploads user privacy to the server, resulting in privacy leakage.

Sample Analysis
After launching, the app opens the LicenseService service:

This service starts the f thread to register and release spy sub-packages:

Registration URL: http://ckoen.dmkatti.com

Dynamic loading of spy sub-packages:

Sub-package analysis

The main package reflectively calls the Execute method of the com.android.preferences.AndroidR class:

First, it establishes a socket connection:

Socket address: mtk.baimind.com

Through communication with the phone, it sends control commands and uploads some private information such as SMS, contacts, call logs, geolocation, and browser history.

Additionally, the spy sub-package establishes HTTPS communication used to upload large files such as audio recordings, screenshots, documents, photos, and videos.

HTTPS address:
https://jang.goongnam.com/resource/request.php (currently inactive; this C2 belongs to OceanLotus assets)

CC Location	Function
mtk.baimind.com	dex file, socket communication receiving remote commands
jang.goongnam.com	dex file, uploading screenshots, audio files, documents, etc.

Table 2. CC Locations and Functions

As shown below: firstly, the signature Subject contains "HackingTeam" and "Christian Pozz" (the name of an administrator from Hacking Team); secondly, the registration functionality in the code indicates it is commercial spyware sold externally; lastly, according to leaked documents from Hacking Team, the country OceanLotus belongs to is also on its client list.

Extended Analysis
Based on the common origin of the registered CC, we found the following samples:

MD5	Program Name
C630AB7B51F0C0FA38A4A0F45C793E24	Google Play services
BF1CA2DAB5DF0546AACC02ABF40C2F19	ChromeUpdate
45AE1CB1596E538220CA99B29816304F	FlashUpdate
CE5BAE8714DDFCA9EB3BB24EE60F042D	Google Play services
D1EB52EF6C2445C848157BEABA54044F	AdAway
50BFD62721B4F3813C2D20B59642F022	Google Play services

Table 3. Homologous Samples Found via CC Retrieval

Unlike the analyzed sample, the above samples have significant functional improvements, adding privilege escalation. Taking 45AE1CB1596E538220CA99B29816304F as an example, decrypting the file named dataOff.db in its assets directory reveals a privilege escalation configuration file, as shown below:

This confirms the statement by the CEO of Hacking Team after the code leak that “the leaked code is only a small part.” This also indirectly reflects how cyber arms dealers have lowered the barrier for APT attacks to some extent, causing greater uncertainty in cyberattacks.

We also noticed that this series of malicious codes has been distributed through domestic third-party app stores and file-sharing websites.

Summary
The OceanLotus group is constantly evolving, continuously updating its attack techniques and weaponry to bypass security software defenses. Besides constantly updating its weapon library, the group is also very familiar with China’s situation, including policies and user habits. This not only confuses related personnel and increases attack success rates but may also cause immeasurable losses to target victims.

Therefore, for individuals, it is essential to improve cybersecurity awareness and not be deceived by phishing information. For security vendors, it is even more necessary to deepen understanding of this group, continuously conduct targeted countermeasures, enhance security defense capabilities, and truly safeguard users’ mobile security.
