Russian Hacker Group APT29 Attempts to Steal COVID-19 Vaccine Information  
According to a Wired report, intelligence agencies from the UK, US, and Canada have accused the Russian state-sponsored hacking group APT29 of launching targeted attacks against COVID-19 vaccine programs. Officials from these three countries claim there is evidence that APT29 members attacked pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions involved in vaccine development, attempting to steal intellectual property and information about potential vaccine candidates. The hackers employed "custom malware" not previously linked to Russia along with known vulnerabilities in widely-used software such as VPNs, utilizing spear-phishing attacks to collect login credentials for target organizations' networked storage systems. The confidence in attribution evidence prompted rare public condemnation from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Canada's Communications Security Establishment, and US agencies including NSA and DHS, coinciding with the British government's assertion of Russian interference in the 2019 general election. Western intelligence communities widely associate APT29 with Russian intelligence services, noting its involvement in numerous cyberattacks including the 2016 Democratic National Committee breach during the US presidential election, where it collaborated with Fancy Bear and APT28. NCSC Operations Director Paul Chichester condemned these "despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic," while the agency released an advisory detailing APT29's efforts against vaccine development. Though officials declined to confirm successful breaches, NCSC guidance indicated APT29 conducted basic vulnerability scans on specific external IP addresses and deployed public exploits against vulnerable services, successfully leveraging disclosed vulnerabilities in Citrix networking systems and VPNs to gain initial footholds in universities and enterprises. The advisory warned that APT29 may deploy additional tools or hijack legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access, potentially using anonymization services when operating with stolen credentials. Technical analysis revealed APT29's use of custom malware including WellMess and a newer variant WellMail, described by NCSC as lightweight malware capable of executing shell commands and file transfers through HTTP, TLS, and DNS channels, with observed activity dating back to at least 2018.
