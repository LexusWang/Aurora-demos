Comprehensive Analysis of Recent Exposed SWIFT System Targeted Attacks on Banking Institutions  
Since the exposure of the Bangladesh Central Bank cyber heist involving $81 million theft in February 2016, multiple SWIFT system-targeted attacks against financial institutions including Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank and Ecuador's Banco del Austro have been disclosed. Our technical report "The Vulnerability of SWIFT: Preliminary Analysis of Cyber Attacks Against Tien Phong Bank" [1] was published following immediate retrospective analysis of related attack samples. During investigations into Bangladesh and Vietnam incidents, we identified connections among four recent banking attacks suggesting coordinated operations by single or multiple threat groups. Code homology analysis confirms malware links to Lazarus Group in Bangladesh and Vietnam cases, though attribution remains unconfirmed. The attackers demonstrated deep familiarity with target banking workflows, indicating prolonged reconnaissance. Successful financial theft required initial network compromise to obtain SWIFT operational privileges, exposing critical security vulnerabilities in financial infrastructure. Despite current disclosures focusing on overseas institutions, transnational APT campaigns against financial sectors including domestic Chinese banks have been repeatedly observed. Combined with underground operations targeting end-users revealed in "DarkMobileBank Tracking Analysis Report" [2], this necessitates urgent reassessment of security risks and innovative defense strategies against emerging threats. **Bangladesh Central Bank Attack Retrospective** **Background** On February 5, 2016, attackers obtained SWIFT system access at Bangladesh Central Bank, issuing fraudulent transfer orders through New York Fed's accounts. Of 35 forged transactions totaling $951 million, 5 transfers worth $101 million were approved. $20 million was recovered due to spelling errors, leaving $81 million stolen. The captured malware (evtdiag.exe) modified SWIFT Alliance Access client authentication instructions and manipulated transaction records. **Attack Workflow** Figure 1 illustrates evtdiag.exe's execution: 1. Process injection to bypass permission checks 2. Read gpca.dat config containing transord entries, dates, and C2 (196.202.103.174:80) 3. Time-triggered operations starting February 5, 2016 4. MT900 message tampering and printer control 5. System status monitoring until self-deletion at 06:00 February 6 **MT900 Tampering Techniques** Attackers manipulated MT900 debit confirmation messages through: - 60F/60M field modification adjusting debit/credit markers - 61/62/64 field recalculations based on Money_at/Money_not parameters - 19A and 90B field adjustments in foff/fofp directory files - Database manipulation via modified liboradb.dll (Oracle Call Interface component) **Cross-Incident Analysis** **SWIFT Official Responses** SWIFT denied responsibility for Bangladesh incident [4], emphasizing local security failures. Subsequent initiatives included: - May 2016 customer security enhancement tools [6] - Five-point security strategy implementation [8] - Stricter software requirements and transaction monitoring **Tactical Patterns** Four bank attacks (2013 Sonali Bank, 2015 Banco del Austro/Tien Phong, 2016 Bangladesh) shared operational patterns: 1. SWIFT credential compromise via keyloggers/phishing 2. Fraudulent MT103/MT950 transaction generation 3. Evidence elimination through modified MT9XX messages 4. Specialized secure deletion function implementation **Code Homology** Malware from Bangladesh/Vietnam attacks shared unique secure deletion function with Lazarus Group's 2014 Sony attack tools and Backdoor.Fimlis samples [12]. The function employs: - 0x5F overwrite on file endings - 6-byte control pattern for multi-pass erasure **Conclusions** 1. Coordinated campaign execution by organized group(s) 2. Deep familiarity with banking workflows through persistent reconnaissance 3. Code-level connections to Lazarus Group infrastructure 4. Systemic financial sector vulnerabilities in SWIFT implementation and network security The attacks highlight critical needs for: - Physical authentication mechanisms supplementing SWIFT access - Enhanced transaction pattern monitoring - Cross-border cybersecurity collaboration - Continuous security architecture reassessment against APT evolution [Technical implementation details and IOCs omitted for brevity]
