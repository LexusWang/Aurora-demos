Operation PaperFolding Cyber Attacks Targeting Military and Government Institutions Across South Asia  
1 Background Overview South Asia has long been a focal region for APT attacks. Since 2014, Antiy has exposed multiple attack groups including the White Elephant organization through reports like "The Dance of White Elephant: Cyber Attacks from South Asia" and "The Latent Elephant Herd: Serial Cyber Attack Campaigns from South Asia". In 2019, Antiy CERT captured multiple attack batches targeting military, governmental, and educational entities across South Asia, primarily in Pakistan with limited distribution to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives. Attack vectors included diverse lure documents covering military affairs, geopolitical disputes, nuclear weapons, and regional conferences. Malware tools encompassed both open-source and self-developed payloads, including a USB-based bridge malware bypassing air-gapped networks. Active since July 2017, these campaigns were attributed to the "Young Elephant" group (named for immature TTPs) showing connections with the "SideWinder" group. We designated this operation "PaperFolding" based on attackers' resource-limited camouflage tactics. 2 Attack Campaign Analysis In June 2019, Pakistan's NTISB issued a national alert regarding phishing campaigns against defense and government entities, including PAEC credential harvesting through fake websites. PITC revealed spear-phishing themes like "Key Discussion Points During China-India Summit" and "PAF Official Salaries", using forged senders like dgpr.paknavy.gov.pk@email.com. Lures distributed via pakcert.gov-pk.org included LNK files, EXE masquerading as PDFs, and macro documents displaying decoy content. Attackers employed icon spoofing, RAR SFX packages, and exploited CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802. Malware involved C++-based info-stealers with USB propagation, Python/Go payloads, and Empire/Exploit Pack frameworks. Table 2-1 Campaign Characteristics Attack Timeline: Active since July 2017 Targets: Pakistan-centric, secondary focus on Bangladesh/Sri Lanka/Maldives Sectors: Government, Military, Nuclear, Education TTPs: Spear-phishing, watering holes, icon spoofing, macro abuse Payloads: Custom C++ stealers, Python/Go malware, Empire framework Table 2-2 Representative Lures Registration_Details.zip (2019-10-13): Air University introduction Betrayal_of_Pakistan_by_China.exe (2018-12-18): Kashmir military strategy IONS Contact List.pdf.exe (2017-11-27): Indian Ocean Naval Symposium Domain spoofing included pakcert.gov-pk.org mimicking PAEC and quwa-paf.servehttp.com impersonating defense analysis platforms. Phishing sites targeted Bangladesh Navy (mail.navy.mil.bd) and Maldivian MFA (foreign.gov.mv). 3 Sample Analysis 3.1 Icon-Spoofed EXE Sample ISI_Role_Sino-PAK_Nuclear_Deal.exe (MD5:3D6AAB4E4E055B9C50837C6ADC97E060) displayed decoy BMPs about nuclear cooperation while dropping tasksmngr.exe for persistence. The malware collected credentials via WM_DEVICECHANGE triggers, exfiltrating data through removable drives when offline and C2 (ntc-pk.sytes.net) when online. 3.2 RAR SFX Sample Karachi GOlf Club Newsletter june 2017.pdf.exe executed RichAudio.exe (Python backdoor) while displaying golf club newsletters. C2 communication involved GMAIL exfiltration and 110.10.176.193. 3.3 Malicious LNK Sample Eligibility.pdf.lnk (MD5:791253aded5df197d9db441a6fe2eb4e) executed HTA scripts fetching PDF decoys and Base64-encoded Python payloads (pdat.exe) connecting to quwa-paf.servehttp.com. 3.4 Document Exploits RTF sample Pay_Slip2.txt (MD5:9c9ff19affff6d62e72e618f2b7284da) leveraged CVE-2017-11882 to deliver Empire payloads. Macro-enabled learnObot.docm used PowerShell for C2 (110.10.176.193). 3.5 Linux Payload ELF sample intern (MD6:6a19e8a202dfdb11bf3aaf9e53f8776a) created reverse shells via Exploit Pack frameworks. 4 Attribution Analysis Upload traces linked to Indian IPs distributing test samples and C2 infrastructure (115.111.244.34). Overlaps with SideWinder TTPs included shared MachineIDs (desktop-q1k**i) and reused IP 185.225.17.40. 5 Infrastructure 12 domains (10 dynamic DNS, 2 registered) and 5 private IPs comprised attack infrastructure. 6 ATT&CK Mapping Initial Access (T1192), Execution (T1064), Persistence (T1053), Collection (T1005), Exfiltration (T1048). 7 Conclusion This multi-year campaign demonstrates basic technical capabilities but effective social engineering against Pakistani targets. Defense recommendations include email filtering, endpoint protection (Antiy AVL), and network monitoring (Antiy TDS).
