Group Background
Mysterious Elephant is a South Asian APT group first named by Kaspersky in its Q2 2023 APT trends report [1]. Domestic vendors have identified the ORPCBackdoor, originally attributed to the Bitter group, appearing in campaigns linked to Mysterious Elephant [2, 3]. Due to attribution uncertainties, some vendors have assigned a separate identifier to this actor rather than merging it with Bitter. Currently, open-source information shows Mysterious Elephant has close ties with several South Asian APT groups, especially in terms of tactics resembling Bitter. Targeted countries include Pakistan, among others.

Incident Overview
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center recently discovered a series of unusual CHM files. These CHM files contain very simple HTML scripts—usually just executing an external file (e.g., “UsoCoreService”). Because these scripts do not include obvious malicious code, they exhibit low detection rates on VirusTotal.

The CHM files include decoy images and use the double extension trick (.pdf.chm) to masquerade as PDF documents. The lure themes focus on South Asian countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, covering government, military, diplomatic, and economic sectors. Some samples imitate red-team-style phishing lures, explicitly targeting Pakistan’s military and defense departments.

The external files executed by the CHM are C# backdoors. The code is similar to samples described in a public report on Bitter group’s malware arsenal [4]. The report references a weapon-storing server libraofficeonline[.]com, which also hosts known Mysterious Elephant tools such as ORPCBackdoor, WalkerShell, and DemoTrySpy [5].

Due to the complex interrelations among South Asian APT actors and differing analytical perspectives, the security industry has not reached a consensus on whether Mysterious Elephant should be considered distinct from Bitter. To avoid further confusion, this report attributes the CHM attacks and C# backdoors—based on malware similarity—to Mysterious Elephant.

Phishing Sample Construction
According to disclosed samples [8, 9], attackers deliver payloads via encrypted ZIP archives. Both the CHM file and the C# backdoor are included, but the backdoor file has hidden file attributes, making it invisible after extraction.

Victims only see the CHM file, which may pass antivirus scans due to minimal embedded script, lowering suspicion and increasing the likelihood of execution—thereby launching the hidden backdoor.

C# Backdoor Behavior
The backdoor is written in C# with async Task programming, and some variants are protected with ConfuserEx. It is relatively simple, primarily designed to:

Execute cmd commands issued by the C2

Some variants support additional attack commands

C2 Acquisition Methods
The backdoors use multiple strategies to retrieve the C2 server address:

Hardcoded in code

The simplest method: the C2 is directly embedded in the binary.

Decrypted from config files

E.g., samples 00f2df1829893caa85f3968961b6e736 and 316e8d798f7db625c207532e2f7a5d38 read a file named SysConfig.enc from the same directory, then decrypt it using AES to get the C2.

Masqueraded network queries

E.g., a3a06d50438681fc9917e22c41bd2cab uses:
hxxp://easyiplookup.com:5080/main/get_ip_data?userId=zqlCYqgp4f&ip=8.8.8.8
It extracts the RequestId field from the response, then base64-decodes it to get the C2:
91.132.92.231:5959
The same IP also uses port 6060 for communication.

The domain easyiplookup.com appears to run an IP query service on port 80. The website uses a script (custom.js) to query ip-api.com, and clicking its "Lookup" button triggers the same URL used by the backdoor, confirming that the site is controlled by the attacker.

Would you like this translated into Chinese again for cross-checking, or should I proceed with the next section?

Other C# backdoors that obtain C2 information in the same way include:

MD5	URL Request	Obtained C2 Info
4e8e1339f9754d8d2c5f74cb03f44fbb	hxxp://winfreecloud.net:6396/athena/identification?name=f0inqMaHra&addr=6.5.6.2	162.252.175.131:8246
115fb536e981c87873b0f35cb0059d93	hxxp://winfreecloud.net:6396/athena/identification?name=9az1g3qdYp&addr=9.9.9.9	46.183.186.208:6060

Both winfreecloud.net and easyiplookup.com resolve to the same IPs (151.236.9.75 and 84.32.84.32).

Backdoor Functionality

After connecting to the C2 server, the backdoor uses the hostname and username of the infected device as the victim identifier.

The majority of the backdoors only support remote command execution or creating a cmd.exe shell for further operations by the attacker.

Some backdoors support additional C2 instructions.

The sample with MD5 a59fe2c89b0000a360a8468f2b990c73 supports the following C2 commands:

C2 Command Code	Function
dir	List file names and subdirectories in the specified directory
cat	Read file content
copy	Copy files
whoami	Display username
upload	Upload files
tasklist	List all process information and executable file paths
schtasks	List all scheduled task names and descriptions
download	Download files
systeminfo	Obtain system information, including OS version, serial number, and available physical memory
other	Command execution

The sample with MD5 27ac8eb519679530999e786281e9a578 supports the following C2 commands:

C2 Command Code	Function
dir	List file names and subdirectories in the specified directory
copy	Copy files

Related Samples

The backdoor sample 316e8d798f7db625c207532e2f7a5d38 also appeared in another archive. The configuration file SysConfig.enc is decrypted to obtain C2 information: 46.183.187.42:443.

These related samples can be divided into two categories. Samples 1–4 use resume documents as lures and feature C++ backdoors that use Tencent Cloud services as C2, belonging to domestic red team attack samples.

Samples 5 and 6 use PDF lure content related to Pakistan's national defense and military. The employed C# backdoor (MD5: 5e7dba4aafb8176ab026e2f4aa3211dd) shares code similarities with the CHM-related backdoors mentioned earlier. The C2 server information is also obtained via AES decryption from a configuration file named “license”. Both archives share the same configuration file, and the C2 is 158.255.215.115:443.

Based on the VT upload times and archive file timestamps, we believe the attacker has imitated publicly known red team phishing samples to craft new ones targeting Pakistan.

Attribution

The C# backdoor resembles malicious samples hosted in the "op" directory of the libraofficeonline[.]com server mentioned in report [4].

Taking the backdoor a59fe2c89b0000a360a8468f2b990c73 as an example, the following malware in the "op" directory exhibits similarities, including the use of asynchronous programming with Task, sending machine name and username to the C2 server as victim identification, and using similar function names and output message strings.

Since ORPCBackdoor was initially believed to be a new backdoor used by the Bitter group, and was later attributed by various domestic and international security vendors to a newly tracked group named Mysterious Elephant, this may explain the attribution inconsistency. In order to remain consistent with previous open-source reports disclosing ORPCBackdoor-related activity and avoid introducing further divergence, this article assesses that the CHM files and C# backdoors targeting multiple South Asian countries likely originate from the Mysterious Elephant group.

Conclusion

The CHM samples involved in this attack campaign targeted South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, affecting sectors such as government agencies, defense, and diplomacy. The attackers employed a relatively uncommon tactic using CHM files that directly launch external files without embedding other malicious code. All external files related to the CHM samples are C# backdoors. Some of these C# backdoors disguise the C2 address retrieval process as access to seemingly legitimate online services, and then parse the C2 address from the response. The attackers also mimicked red team phishing samples and reused the same C# backdoor within them. These signs indicate that the threat actor has been experimenting with various attack methods and making efforts to disguise their operations.
