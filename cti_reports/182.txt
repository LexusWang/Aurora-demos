Summary
The CNC group, with South Asian background as named by peer vendors, initially shared the same GitHub repository with Patchwork. For a long time, we tracked it as Patchwork. In the past two years, this group has targeted domestic scientific researchers, students, and institutions exclusively. Their later-stage plugins have become modular and customized, with evasion capabilities significantly better than other South Asian APT groups. This warrants a systematic disclosure. Operation Sea Elephant aims to spy on China’s marine research achievements to ensure a certain South Asian country’s dominance in the Indian Ocean.

In mid-2024, we discovered an attack cluster identified as UTG-Q-011 from the South Asian direction. Although its subsequent plugins differ greatly from CNC, its backdoor uses the same codebase as CNC. Therefore, UTG-Q-011 is studied as a subset of CNC and will be disclosed at the end of this report.

This paper is solely for security research and does not focus on initial sample payloads. It mainly reveals CNC’s unpublished plugins and espionage goals. Tianqing can detect and remove all their backdoors and plugins. We recommend research institutes and universities enable cloud lookup to discover unknown threats.

Plugin Overview
CNC mainly gains initial access by spear-phishing targeted researchers or units, then controls the victim’s IM software (WeChat, QQ) to send bait Windows programs to colleagues or students for lateral movement. When deploying plugins, attackers customize based on local antivirus software. For example, we observed CNC releasing a backdoor named qaxreporter.exe under AppData\roaming\QAXSecurityReporter, creating a scheduled task named “QI-ANXIN Security Task.” Below we classify and disclose plugins by their functions.

Remote Command Execution Backdoors
Attackers designed two types of plugins solely for executing CMD commands. File names typically include windowassistance.exe, HuaweiHiSuiteService64.exe, mscleanup64.exe, and konlinesetupupdate_xa.exe.

Type 1
Reads command instructions from GitHub:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkrightjack/controlid/main/feed.json
The data package has two formats, one starting with “juiop-drt!” and the other with “tuiju-opu!”.
The CMD execution results are uploaded back to the attacker’s C2 server.

Type 2
Uses a third-party SSL library to communicate with a remote server for CMD execution.
The latest plugin version first collects local machine info and appends it to a user_agent string, then sends a POST request to C2 on port 443.
Subsequently, it connects to C2 on port 4545 for command interaction.

GitHub API Backdoor
Named windowsfilters.exe, it replaces foreign VPS with the GitHub API for remote control. On startup, it collects device UUID and username, encrypts them, and writes to C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCookies.WebDecodedCache.

Then it requests the GitHub API for the file: /repos/SalmonQt/Webdriver/contents/Ameroyt2dstg.txt.
The returned content is base64-decoded from the content field, representing a victim list. The backdoor checks if the current device is on the list; if not, it uploads itself to the list.
It then uses GitHub API to fetch Filgwru5va.txt, which contains instructions.
The instructions are a base64-decoded JSON structure, including a UUID check and command execution such as folder listing, screenshot capture, and CMD command execution. Commands only run if UUID matches.

USB Propagation Plugin
Named YoudaoGui.exe, it first accesses www.163.com to check network connectivity.
Its execution logic depends on where the malware resides:

In appdata\roaming folder
If in appdata\roaming, it repeatedly scans for newly mounted drives (e.g., inserted USB drives).
It checks if the drive contains a file named “私人.png.exe.” If absent, it copies itself as “私人.png.exe” onto the new drive to propagate.
After copying, it reports the result to C2: https://185.140.12.224/licenseAdministrator/discover.xml.
Then it scans for .doc and .ppt files on the new drive and copies them to appdata\roaming\AdbRc.

Not in appdata\roaming folder
If not in appdata\roaming, the malware runs as “私人.png.” It first loads an embedded image resource for disguise.
It then downloads a second-stage malware srclogsys.exe from C2 https://185.140.12.224/.vendor/git/srclog, places it under AppData\Roaming, and creates a scheduled task for it.

Then it collects the device process information and uploads it as an identifier to the C2 server at:
https://185.140.12.224/logindex.php?q=ascii
From the URL content, this step’s purpose is to register the device as online on the control side.

Once online, it creates a cmd process to start srclogsys.exe.

Finally, it enters remote control logic, continuously fetching commands issued by the malicious GitHub account “kkrightjack” and executing them via cmd.

Keylogger Plugin
File name: sogou_pinyinupdater.exe
It stores victim keystrokes in plaintext at:
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\SogouPinyinInput.suggestions_kaomoji

File Stealing Plugins
CNC employs various file theft plugins with differing logic each time they steal data, including custom plugins targeting specific victims.

Type 1
File name: tericerit.exe
Hardcoded target directories are embedded in the plugin.

Main functions:

Write a list of all files under the path into an ext file in the same directory.

Copy all doc documents from the directory and subdirectories into the zD1Leno51 folder, then encrypt and package them.

Upload the package to the C2 server via SFTP.
The remote server immediately transfers and deletes the uploaded files and restricts user permissions for logged-in accounts.

Type 2
File name: filecoauthx86.exe
Creates a scheduled task named VerifiedPublisherCertCheck.

If not running from the C drive, it scans all files on its residing drive:

Checks for a file named backuplog_2024.txt.

If absent, initiates a downloader logic that fetches the Type 2 remote command execution backdoor (MScleanup64.exe).
The purpose of this payload is likely to steal the collected files.

Type 3
This involves two files: aliyun_updater64.exe (collects files) and CacheStore.exe (transfers files).

aliyun_updater64.exe first checks if CacheStore.exe exists in:
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches

If found, it directly launches CacheStore.exe with a fixed folder path parameter:
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches{3DA71D5A-20CC-432F-A115-DFE92379E91F}.3.ver0xY

Then it accesses:
https://aliyunconsole.com/alcloud/dgyx-4121-Firnsnxywfytw
to download cversions.dgyx-4121-Firnsnxywfytw.db into the above cache folder.

The downloaded database contains attacker-predefined file paths. The malware:

Reads the db file.

Traverses the defined paths to search files.

Filters collected files by extension and size (only files larger than 40,960 bytes).

The specific file extensions are provided encoded in BASE64 (not included here).

If the files meet the requirements, they will be copied to the folder:
Caches{3DA71D5A-20CC-432F-A115-DFE92379E91F}.3.ver0xkNGCDCY^XK^EX.

Finally, it accesses the URL https://aliyunconsole.com/product/VectorRetrievalService/dashvector to download CacheStore.exe and launch it.

CacheStore.exe is an upload plugin whose function is to take the command-line argument as the specified folder path and upload the files in that folder to the C2 server at: 2.58.15.28:8090.

Determination to Dominate the Indian Ocean
In recent years, a certain South Asian country has been committed to establishing dominance in the Indian Ocean region, viewing it as a strategic backyard. It has deepened strategic cooperation with South Asian countries and promoted regional economic and security initiatives, demonstrating a strong determination to dominate the Indian Ocean.

However, Operation Sea Elephant appears to reveal that this country's actual scientific research capabilities lag far behind its grand ambitions. The files stolen by the CNC group, after desensitization, are as follows:

Files or directories:
XXXXX Internal Wave Water Transport/
May Fourth Evaluation/
Marine Sequestration XXXXX Geological Factor Research/
transient responses-20240911.docx
Second half XXXX Project Node Assessment Key Issues Meeting PPT XX Version.docx

XXXX-final-safety science-title page (XXXXXXXX).docx

…

Although these are conclusive scientific research documents on Windows platforms and do not include production data, these files still serve as important references for foreign intelligence organizations to probe China’s project progress and technical directions. By analyzing these documents, they can infer the technical strength, resource allocation, and future strategic layout of Chinese research teams.

As mentioned in our previous Operation Veles [1]: production scientific data such as source code and stage experimental data are typically stored on Linux server clusters. UTG-Q-008 managed to steal these after years of accumulation and massive network resources, which is very difficult for other groups. Higher-class classified scientific projects are completely isolated in air-gapped networks. Worldwide, only a handful of APT groups can penetrate gateways and such devices, and security vendors lack visibility in this area. Therefore, for a long time to come, APT confrontation in the science and education field will still focus on Windows platforms.

UTG-Q-011
The initial payload of UTG-Q-011 is released in the form of resume lures, targeting espionage in fields such as laser science and aerospace.

Two homologous downloaders release two types of malware with zero detections on VT:

Communicates with C2 via SSL protocol to receive information.

Executes commands based on received instructions.

Instruction functions correspond as follows:

Case 0: Create specified process

Case 1: Change working directory

Case 2: Terminate connection and exit malware

Case 4: Read specified file content

Case 5: Terminate current connection and connect to newly assigned C2

Case 6: No function

Case 7: Collect specified file

The malware first creates a folder at:
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\msedgeCache

This function is expected to receive a command composed of three bracketed segments, matched by a regex created by the malware.

File collection works by adding specified files into a compressed archive under the msedgeCache folder. Judging by the functionality, the three parts of the command are likely: archive name, file to add, and archive password.

The archive addition uses the Chilkat library.

The second malware’s logic is similar to CNC’s remote command execution backdoor, used only to execute cmd commands and uses the same third-party SSL library.

If no command is issued, it sends a heartbeat packet "ddd".

The main plugins subsequently pushed by UTG-Q-011 are open-source plugins for stealing browser data, which do not overlap with CNC organization’s complex plugins.

Summary
Currently, all product lines based on Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Center’s threat intelligence data, including the Qi An Xin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, Qi An Xin NGSOC, Qi An Xin Situational Awareness, etc., already support precise detection of these types of attacks.
