Operation Mermaid  
Operation Mermaid is an overseas APT group's cyber espionage campaign primarily targeting government agencies, with confirmed attacks against the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The activity spanned six years, with the earliest traces dating back to April 2010 and the most recent attack observed in January 2016. To date, we have captured 284 malicious code samples and identified 35 C&C domains. In June 2015, we first identified malware linked to this operation. While the payload delivery methods and specific targets in China remain unclear due to limited local activity, big data correlation analysis revealed the campaign's origin in April 2010 and associated hundreds of malicious samples. We suspect watering hole attacks were employed for payload delivery, supported by decoy document content and intelligence data, indicating targeted information theft against English or Persian-speaking entities. In January 2016, Denmark's CFCS published a report detailing spear-phishing attacks against its Foreign Ministry from December 2014 to July 2015, which we confirmed as part of Operation Mermaid. The attackers primarily used PowerPoint OLE phishing documents embedding multiple PE files to bypass security warnings through repetitive prompts. A suspected watering hole attack leveraged the Kurdish news site kurdistannet.org, which hosted persistent malicious links (e.g., hXXp://wpstat.mine.bz/e1/stat1.php) until at least January 2016. The malware employed WinRAR self-extracting executables disguised as patches, development tools, or media files. Two variants of the SD RAT were identified: V1 (pre-2012) using timer-based keylogging and clipboard monitoring, and V2 (post-2012) implementing hotkey-based logging with encrypted strings. V2 exhibited unusual Avast directory checks and cautious execution logic when detecting Kaspersky/Symantec products. C&C analysis revealed domain registrations tied to Middle Eastern email addresses (aminjalali_58@yahoo.com, aj58mail-box@yahoo.com). A Sophos forum user (aj58) disputed malicious classifications for domains updateserver1.com and bestupdateserver.com, which overlapped with Operation Mermaid's infrastructure. Three domains (short-name.com, bestwebstat.com, myblog2000.com) were sinkholed by virustracker.info in July 2015. Decoy documents containing Persian text, Syrian conflict-related news excerpts, and Middle Eastern usernames (e.g., "ya hosain") suggest the threat actor's origin in the Middle East. The appendix details aj58's Sophos forum interactions disputing domain blacklisting between July 25-August 5, 2015, coinciding with CFCS's reported attack timeline.
