PJobRAT Spyware Targeting Indian Military Personnel
360 Netlab recently discovered a new Android malware campaign primarily targeting Indian military-related personnel, designated as PJobRAT based on its package structure. The malware masquerades as Indian dating/matrimonial and instant messaging applications. Through homologous sample analysis, we assess the campaign commenced in January 2021, with the RAT family potentially originating as early as December 2019, specifically targeting Indian individuals with military affiliations. PJobRAT primarily impersonates Trendbanter, a top-tier Indian dating/matrimonial application aggregating thousands of Indian singles globally. Notably, the malware displays different icons on the home screen (WhatsApp icon) versus the app list (Trendbanter icon) for enhanced concealment. Technical analysis reveals PJobRAT exfiltrates documents (pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx), harvests WhatsApp messages via Android accessibility services, and collects contacts, SMS, multimedia files, installed apps, WiFi/geolocation data, while enabling audio recording. The malware employs Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for command reception and HTTP for data exfiltration. Our investigation identified four additional apps (impersonating Signal and HangOn Messenger) sharing the same C2 server, with three structurally similar samples dating back to late 2019 suggesting evolutionary development. Analysis of publicly accessible C2 servers revealed organized directories containing exfiltrated military-related data from multiple 2021 victims. The attackers likely leveraged India's dating app popularity (6/12 top non-gaming Play Store apps) and WhatsApp's privacy policy controversy to distribute payloads through military forums/social groups. While attribution remains inconclusive, the campaign demonstrates precise targeting of Indian defense personnel through sophisticated social engineering tactics.
