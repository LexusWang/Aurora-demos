Comprehensive Analysis of Iranian Chafer APT Group  
The Iran-linked Chafer APT group has been active since 2014, conducting cyber espionage activities. Bitdefender revealed that the group began targeting Middle Eastern critical infrastructure in 2018 using multiple tools and customized backdoors. Its attacks primarily target aviation transportation and government sectors, with most operations conducted during weekends. In Kuwaiti campaigns, attackers created dedicated user accounts, while Saudi Arabian attacks relied on social engineering, both ultimately aiming for data exfiltration. Attack chain analysis for Kuwait initially identified reverse TCP files and PowerShell commands, suggesting malicious document delivery via spear-phishing emails. Attackers deployed reconnaissance tools including "xnet.exe" and "shareo.exe" for network scanning, "mnl.exe" or "mimi32.exe" for credential harvesting, and CrackMapExec for lateral movement. Persistence mechanisms involved modified Plink ("wehsvc.exe") and backdoors ("imjpuexa.exe"), with RDP/psexec used for remote service installation. Most activities occurred on Fridays and Saturdays, aligning with Middle Eastern weekends. Saudi Arabian operations involved RAT components stored in %Download% folder, executed as "drivers.exe" and "drivers_x64.exe", alongside network reconnaissance tool "etblscanner.exe". The "snmp.exe" RAT variant matched Kuwaiti campaign artifacts ("imjpuexa.exe"). Tools analysis revealed usage of Non-Sucking Service Manager for component persistence, Sysinternals tools for lateral movement, and customized utilities including Mimikatz/SafetyKatz for credential dumping. Python-based RATs (v3.4) employed DNS/HTTP communication with hardcoded headers like "GET /owa HTTP/1.1". Additional tools included C# utility "shareo.exe" for NetBIOS enumeration and C++ proxy tool "xnet.exe". The "mas.dll" backdoor showed development links to "xnet.exe" through PDB paths. MITRE ATT&CK TTP mapping covered persistence (T1050/T1053/T1136), discovery (T1016), C2 (T1090), defense evasion (T1045/T1036), execution (T1059), and credential access (T1003).
