APT-C-51
APT35
The APT-C-51 (#APT35) group, also known as Charming Kitten, Phosphorus, and Newscaster, has been active since 2012 with diverse attack strategies. The group's operations primarily target countries such as the UK, the US, and Israel, driven by both political motives and economic interests. Their main targets include human rights activists, media organizations, and members of academia.

Recently, the 360 Advanced Threat Research Institute has captured the group's cyber attack operations targeting the Middle East. The attackers delivered subsequent malicious components via a malicious LNK file, ultimately deploying the #PowerLess trojan through multi-stage loading to conduct espionage.

I. Attack Activity Analysis

Attack Process Analysis
In this attack, the APT-C-51 group used an LNK file to lure victims into clicking. Once executed, it released a decoy document and opened it to deceive the user. It also released several malicious DLLs and encrypted data files, executed the relevant DLLs, and ultimately loaded the PowerLess script through multiple layers of decryption to initiate the espionage operation. The specific process is illustrated in the diagram below:

Payload Delivery Analysis
Recently, we captured a sample of an APT-C-51 attack targeting the Middle East. The sample is an LNK file named “Biography of Mr. leehu hacohn.lnk,” with the following details:

MD5
a52c8eacf3dbdcf0f49268a27a44636b
File Name
Biography of Mr. leehu hacohn.lnk
File Size
1.19 MB (1,251,204 bytes)
The command line parameters carried by the LNK file are as follows. Once executed, the file reads its own data and releases a PDF file named “Biography of Mr. leehu hacohn.pdf” and a compressed package named “osf.zip”. After extracting it, the system uses the regsvr command to register wow.dll and execute malicious code.

Malicious Payload Analysis
The LNK file ultimately executes Wow.dll via regsvr. Details of Wow.dll are as follows:
MD5
92d497053600374b10003aa40ae8e5d8
File Name
Wow.dll
File Size
428 KB (438,784 bytes)
Timestamp

Wow.dll is a DLL file compiled in C/C++. Its main function is to perform environment checks, then load the next-stage payload in memory.
Wow.dll is heavily obfuscated and contains a large amount of irrelevant code to hinder analysis. This is evident from the IDA decompilation results and the graph overview, which show many junk code blocks. Additionally, the obfuscation allows the sample to evade detection effectively — currently, only one antivirus engine on VT flags it as malicious.

Once irrelevant code is removed, the code blocks shrink, and the logic becomes clearer. The following images show the decompilation results and graph overview after deobfuscation.

Wow.dll first checks for the presence of security software and monitoring tool processes. If found, it bypasses AMSI and ETW mechanisms through patching, allowing subsequent PowerShell scripts to execute.

It then reads the gclib file and decrypts the PowerShell script required for the next stage using Base64 and AES algorithms. The AES decryption key is { }nj45kdada0slfk.

Finally, the decrypted PowerShell script is passed as a parameter and executed in memory by loading the new.dll file from the same directory. The entry point is the RunParScript method in the Pins class. If an error occurs during the process, the error information is sent to https://api.telegram.org/bot755****/SendMessage.

Details of new.dll are as follows:

MD5
62fbf0622586324f7177da466d036b8f
File Name
new.dll
File Size
552 KB (565,248 bytes)

new.dll is a C# attack component whose primary function is to execute the PowerShell script passed in.

Attack Component Analysis
Upon analysis, the final loaded PowerShell component is the PowerLess trojan, version “3.3.4”. Its configuration and C2 communication details are as follows:

APT-C-51 (APT35) Latest Attack Activity Analysis
When executed, it first establishes persistence and then sends the current username to a Telegram bot using APIKEY:755009*** and CHATID:-1002486927678 to indicate it is online.

It then collects and sends basic information such as computer name, username, OS, installation path, IP address, manufacturer, and installed antivirus software to the server. The server responds with commands to trigger specific functionalities as shown below:
Command	Function
file_list	Retrieve file/directory info
Command	Execute commands
Shot	Take screenshots
sound	Audio capture
Browser	Browser information theft
klg	Plugin execution
Download	File download
Upload	File upload
update	Configuration update
F_Upload	Retry failed upload

It is worth noting that the audio capture and plugin execution features are carried out using Min.dll. For example, in the case of audio capture, it first checks for the presence of an Applause.wav file in the “LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft Conf” directory. If the file exists, it is encrypted and exfiltrated. If not, it downloads VR.zip, extracts it to get a VR file, loads Min.dll via rundll, and calls the Milo export function with VR as the parameter. The Milo function decrypts and loads the script to implement the data theft and plugin execution functionalities.

Section II: Correlation Analysis
A few months ago, we also captured a test sample of an attack from this group. The sample similarly employed LNK files to deliver a decoy PDF and malicious components. Its execution flow was largely consistent with the current attack; however, the test sample did not bundle several system DLLs, which may cause it to fail in some environments, as shown below.

Similarly, decryption of the gclib file revealed the PowerLess Trojan, version “3.3.0”. The communication C2 for this version was starmanblind.ddns.net, and its functionalities are essentially identical to those of the current attack sample, so they are not repeated here.
Compared to the test sample, the current attack uses the latest version “3.3.4” and has added persistence mechanisms and online notification via Telegram. Additionally, multiple try...catch structures were added throughout the code to enhance robustness, indicating the attackers are actively upgrading their attack components.

Section III: Attribution Assessment
Based on an in-depth analysis of recent APT-C-51 activities, the group exhibits distinctive technical characteristics, summarized as follows:
The final component PowerLess and its loading process in this attack are consistent with the group’s previous campaigns [1]. All use Base64 and AES encryption for decryption and loading. The AES key “0123654789mkiujn” used to decrypt PowerShell scripts from data files matches previous attacks. Additionally, the AES key “{}nj45kdada0slfk” used to decrypt intermediate payloads is also consistent with past activities [2]. PowerShell scripts were also executed via .NET loaders.
The obfuscation techniques used on the C++ PE files are similar, with the inclusion of a large amount of junk code. Moreover, evasion techniques were also employed, such as hooking AMSIscanBuffer and ETWEventWrite API.
Both current and earlier PowerLess samples contain the same spelling mistake, with “stoped” being used instead of “stopped”.

APT-C-51 (APT35) Latest Attack Activity Analysis
The final malicious component communicates with C2 domains using the “.info” TLD, consistent with the group’s historical behavior. Furthermore, a reverse lookup of the IP address (54.39.143.112) associated with the test sample’s C2 (starmanblind.ddns.net) reveals a related domain, defaultbluemarker.info, which has been attributed to the APT-C-51 group by other threat intelligence sources [3].
Based on this analysis and the fact that the target of the attack is the Middle East, in line with the group’s typical objectives, this campaign can be attributed to the APT-C-51 group.

Conclusion
This detailed attack analysis revealed how the APT-C-51 group uses phishing files to gradually deploy the PowerLess Trojan. During execution, the malicious components incorporate extensive junk code to hinder analysis and demonstrate strong evasion capabilities, allowing them to evade detection while exfiltrating user data through multi-stage payloads.
We hereby remind organizations and individuals to raise cybersecurity awareness. Regardless of the operating system, unknown samples should never be executed, as doing so may lead to undetected system compromise and the leak of confidential files and sensitive intelligence.
It should be noted that the malicious code and C&C infrastructure disclosed in this report only represent the tools used in APT-C-51’s recent attacks. The group is unlikely to cease its activities following a single exposure and is expected to continue evolving its payloads. We will maintain ongoing monitoring of their operations.
