Hackers Extort 23000 MongoDB Databases and Threaten to Contact GDPR Authorities  
ZDNet learned today that hackers have uploaded ransom notes to 22900 MongoDB databases exposed online without passwords, accounting for approximately 47% of all MongoDB databases accessible online. Attackers used automated scripts to scan misconfigured MongoDB databases, wipe their contents, and leave ransom notes demanding payment of 0.015 Bitcoin (approximately $140). Threat actors gave companies two days to comply while threatening to leak data and report breaches to local General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforcement authorities. The ransom note READ_ME_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_DATA was first observed in April 2020. GDI Foundation security researcher Victor Gevers told ZDNet via phone that initial attacks didn't include data wiping. Attackers repeatedly connected to the same databases to leave multiple ransom note copies. However, Gevers revealed hackers recently corrected a script error and now fully erase MongoDB databases: "Everything is gone," including production systems with staging data. Gevers noted significant reduction in reportable data leaks from his usual 5-10 cases to just one today. Similar "MongoDB wiping and extortion" attacks have persisted since December 2016, peaking with 28000 servers compromised in January 2017 and 26000 in September 2017. MongoDB Inc.'s David Ottenheimer previously attributed these breaches to database owners failing to set passwords or firewall protections. Despite improved default security settings in modern MongoDB deployments, approximately 48000 exposed servers remain online today, many without authentication enabled. Common exposure causes include administrators following incorrect configuration tutorials or deploying misconfigured server images.
