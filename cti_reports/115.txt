Dismantling the Evil "Bear Ambition" 360 Security Brain Exclusively Discloses OldPanther Gang's Virus Propagation Network  
Recently, 360 Security Brain exclusively discovered a new infectious virus Peviru that initially lurked in Chinese programming language compilation environments, executing a supply chain infection to spread malicious code across the entire network from the source. Analysis reveals that Peviru's self-replicating nature causes all programs compiled by users to become virus carriers, resulting in explosive proliferation through network nodes and causing immeasurable impacts. Currently, 360 Security Brain has uniquely traced Peviru's operators to a hacking group named "OldPanther" based on recurring "oldpanther" identifiers in C2 servers. 360 SafeGuard now provides virus removal and interception, urging users to install it promptly. The virus targets programming language origins through poisoned installers distributed on major developer forums, replicating the XcodeGhost incident's supply chain contamination from 2015. Beyond polluting static compilation environments, Peviru deploys remote access Trojans like DaHuiLang RAT and LimeRAT using multi-stage whitebox exploitation and memory decryption techniques. Technical analysis shows OldPanther possesses extensive penetration tools including NSA-leaked exploits, network scanners, and privilege escalation utilities. 360 SafeGuard effectively removes infected code using AVE engine technology and repair modes. Recommendations include installing 360 SafeGuard from weishi.360.cn, avoiding trust prompts for risky programs, and using 360 Software Manager for verified downloads.
