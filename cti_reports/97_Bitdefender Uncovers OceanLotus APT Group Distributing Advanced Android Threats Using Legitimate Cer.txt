Bitdefender Uncovers OceanLotus APT Group Distributing Advanced Android Threats Using Legitimate Certificates
Since 2014, an APT group known as OceanLotus or PhantomLance has been distributing sophisticated Android threats through official and third-party markets, gaining notoriety for attempting to remotely control infected devices, steal confidential data, install applications, and execute arbitrary code. Bitdefender researchers recently documented the group's activities, identifying 35 new malicious samples and revealing the potential use of legitimate (possibly stolen) digital certificates to sign certain samples. The APT group's modus operandi involves uploading clean versions first before adding malware, then distributing infected Android applications via Google Play and third-party markets. While primarily targeting victims in Africa and Asia, Bitdefender's telemetry also detected scans in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany, and India, with the threat detected as Android.Trojan.OceanLotus. The earliest sample linked to OceanLotus (APK MD5: 315f8e3da94920248676b095786e26ad) appeared on Google Play in April 2014, signed using VL Corporation's certificate generated in July 2013 – a certificate used by over 100 different Google Play applications by 2014 besides OceanLotus malware, suggesting possible certificate leakage/abuse. Telemetry data from the past three months shows 25 reports of this threat, primarily from the United States (potentially sandboxed environments), Japan, and South Korea. Despite Google Play's improved security management, third-party markets like apkpure.com and apkplz.net continue hosting malicious samples, including confirmed Google Play uploads. Attackers typically submit clean versions to Google Play first, then update them with malicious payloads after random intervals – exemplified by the net.vilakeyice.openglplugin app initially uploaded clean on August 5, 2018, before introducing malicious code on August 21. Newer samples now receive decryption keys alongside payloads instead of storing them locally. While OceanLotus attribution remains consistent in security analyses, the persistence of samples on third-party markets (including Amazon India listings under pseudonym Caleb Eisenhauer) poses ongoing risks, particularly in regions without official Google Play access.
