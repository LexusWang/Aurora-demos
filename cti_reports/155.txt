Microsoft Worm-Level Critical SMBv3 Vulnerability Exploit Code Released Immediate Remediation Required
On March 12 this year, a critical vulnerability in Windows 10 - the SMBv3 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-0796) - was exposed, capable of achieving "worm-level" real-world security threats through completely interaction-free exploitation. Based on this discovery, 360 Security Brain became the first domestic entity to conduct technical analysis of this vulnerability and implemented immediate countermeasures to contain its spread. 360 Security Brain has maintained continuous monitoring and tracking of this high-risk SMBv3 vulnerability. Recently, 360 Security Brain exclusively disclosed a complete exploitation chain for this vulnerability. Testing confirmed that the vulnerability can be leveraged not only for local privilege escalation attacks but also poses high-risk remote exploitation threats. However, users need not panic as 360 Security Guard now provides exclusive protection against this unpatched vulnerability through 360 Security Brain's advanced capabilities. This wormable remote exploitation vulnerability presents comparable threats to "Eternal Blue". Analysis from 360 Security Brain indicates the SMBv3 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-0796) primarily threatens Windows 10 and Windows Server versions 1903/1909, meaning over half of Windows 10 users remain vulnerable. Further investigation revealed the vulnerability exists in Windows' SMBv3.0 protocol, classified as a critical zero-interaction remote code execution vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code by sending malicious packets to target SMBv3 servers without any user interaction, leading to unauthorized device control. Combining both remote exploitation capabilities and wormable propagation potential, this vulnerability's threat level equals that of the 2017 Eternal Blue SMB vulnerability, which enabled the global WannaCry ransomware outbreak affecting over 200,000 computers. Beyond remote exploitation equivalence to Eternal Blue, 360 Security Brain's latest monitoring exclusively captured the first complete local privilege escalation exploit details. Attackers can open local SMB shares via port 445, construct arbitrary address write operations, and ultimately achieve privilege escalation through multiple steps. While local privilege escalation poses relatively lower threats than remote exploitation, it remains critical for enabling full system control during network attacks. Considering these dual threats, vigilance remains essential even during the vulnerability's patch lifecycle. Empowered by 360 Security Brain, 360 Security Guard now provides exclusive unpatched vulnerability interception. Final security recommendations include: 1) Install 360 Security Guard from weishi.360.cn for effective vulnerability interception; 2) Regularly update systems and perform security vulnerability scans; 3) Apply Microsoft's official security patches promptly; 4) Maintain security awareness by avoiding suspicious links/attachments and keeping software updated.
