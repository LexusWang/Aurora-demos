Vietnamese State-Backed APT Group OceanLotus Targets Chinese Government Agencies With COVID-19 Themed Attacks  
Overview The recent global outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has drawn widespread attention. Since the epidemic began, Threat Intelligence Bureau has observed multiple APT groups and cybercriminal gangs exploiting this topic for attacks, including White Elephant, GreenSpot, BITTER, OceanLotus (also known as APT32), Kimsuky, and Hades. OceanLotus, a Vietnam-linked hacker group active since at least 2012, has persistently targeted China's energy sector, maritime institutions, coastal construction departments, research institutes, and shipping enterprises. Beyond China, the group also attacks governments, military organizations, large corporations worldwide, as well as domestic media outlets and civil society organizations. Recent hunting operations by Threat Intelligence Bureau revealed new OceanLotus samples exploiting pandemic themes to attack China. Key findings include: attackers conducted spear-phishing campaigns in February 2023 using topical lures like "H5N1 Avian Influenza Outbreak in Hunan Poultry" and "Coronavirus Real-time Update: China Tracking Travelers from Hubei." The attackers utilized digitally signed WPS documents to execute social engineering attacks, employing DLL side-loading techniques to deliver decoy documents and load DenesRAT malware in memory. DenesRAT features file manipulation, registry operations, environment variable configuration, and remote code execution capabilities, with heavy use of junk code to hinder analysis. C2 domain correlations indicate targets included Chinese ministerial-level agencies and multiple Wuhan government institutions. Threat Intelligence Bureau has extracted 5 related IOCs for detection, supported across Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Threat Detection Platform (TDP), and API. Details OceanLotus has consistently targeted China using various methods including living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) and C2 traffic obfuscation. Recent captures show the group leveraging legitimate WPS executables to load malicious DLLs. Two decoy documents were observed: "Hunan Poultry H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Epidemic Status.docx" and "Coronavirus Real-time Update: China Tracking Travelers from Hubei.doc." The attack chain involves digitally signed WPS files side-loading malicious krpt.dll, which decompresses embedded resources to drop decoy documents and construct in-memory backdoor DLL data. The malware repairs import/relocation tables before executing DenesRAT via DllEntry export. Analysis of identical samples reveals: 1) Basic file information showing WPS executables with valid signatures; 2) krpt.dll executing "_force_link_krpt" to release decoys to %TEMP%; 3) Resource file shellcode loading; 4) Loop decryption routines in shellcode header; 5) HTTP beaconing to libjs.inquirerjs.com with hostname/username parameters; 6) Final shellcode execution loading DenesRAT with characteristic junk code; 7) Decrypted C2 configuration pointing to vitlescaux.com:28194 for encrypted TCP communications. DenesRAT's capabilities include file operations, registry manipulation, remote code execution, and environment variable configuration. Correlation Analysis Technical evidence including TTPs, malware characteristics, and infrastructure confirms OceanLotus responsibility. Historical data shows libjs.inquirerjs.com domain reuse from previous OceanLotus campaigns. Recent suspicious URLs on this domain contained probes targeting email addresses including x****c@china*****.gov.cn, wu****zs@wuhan.gov.cn, and y****c@126.com. Threat Intelligence Bureau confirms these belong to Chinese ministerial and Wuhan municipal government entities, demonstrating the operation's malicious intent.
